#   1. Build      — the app compiles
#   2. Transcript — scripted audio through the real ParakeetPipeline
#                   scores <= 5% WER; silence produces nothing; a
#                   mid-speech stop still flushes the tail
#   3. Nudges     — deterministic signal replay matches the golden;
#                   talkTime fires on time with Parakeet-shaped commits
#   4. Trend      — signal-engine benchmark over real saved sessions,
#                   recorded to bench/history.jsonl (informational)
#
# Skip in an emergency with: SKIP_GATE=1 git push
# Faster run (skips the 30s window-cap audio case): FAST=1 git push
