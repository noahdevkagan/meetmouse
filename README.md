# MeetMouse

A local-first, zero-telemetry real-time leadership coach for macOS. It listens to a live meeting, applies a facilitation rubric, and surfaces short coaching calls while the meeting is happening — shown in a small, screen-share-safe overlay.

Forked from [anarlog](https://github.com/fastrepl/anarlog) (MIT), which already handles audio capture, on-device transcription, and bring-your-own-LLM including local models. The coaching layer is the new work.

**Privacy:** transcription is fully on-device and telemetry is zero. AI runs locally via Ollama (`127.0.0.1`) by default and local mode works with WiFi off. Users can explicitly enable Claude or OpenAI in **Settings → AI** using their own API key. Cloud mode sends the text and context needed by AI features directly to the selected provider; audio stays on-device. API usage is billed by that provider. Keys are stored in device-only macOS Keychain.

To enable cloud AI, choose a provider and model, paste an API key, optionally test the connection, accept text sharing, then click **Save and enable**. **Use local AI** stops future cloud requests. Provider changes apply to the next meeting and the next on-demand AI request. A connection failure leaves transcription and built-in coaching working.

See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the full build plan and [`findings.md`](./findings.md) for the Phase 0 recon.

## Install (macOS)

**Download the app:** grab the latest `MeetMouse-*.dmg` from
[Releases](../../releases), open it, and drag **MeetMouse** to Applications.
It's signed and notarized, so it opens with a normal double-click.

**First launch:** the app bundles the Ollama runtime, so you don't install
anything else — just click **Download model** once to fetch a local model
(needs WiFi for that one download; everything after runs offline).

### Build from source
Requires Xcode 16+ and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/noahdevkagan/meetmouse.git
cd meetmouse/MeetingCoach
xcodegen
xcodebuild -project MeetingCoach.xcodeproj -scheme MeetingCoach \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build build
open -n build/Build/Products/Debug/MeetMouse.app
```
For local LLM features when running a source build, either have
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) running, or vendor the runtime into the bundle with
`./scripts/vendor-ollama.sh`.

**Working with an AI coding agent?** Point it at [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) —
setup, build, test, and repo-specific gotchas in one file (Codex reads it
automatically; Claude Code loads it via `CLAUDE.md`; an optional `.mcp.json`
adds Xcode build tooling over MCP).

Maintainers: see [`DISTRIBUTION.md`](./DISTRIBUTION.md) for cutting signed releases.

## Use your transcripts with AI

Every meeting is saved as plain Markdown in
`~/Documents/MeetingCoach/transcripts/` (the path is shown — and changeable —
in Settings → General). No integration needed: point Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor,
or any other AI tool at that folder and it can read everything.

- **Filenames sort and glob:** `2026-08-31T14-30_partner-sync_chad-anna.md`
  — ISO date-time, then the meeting title and participants, slugified.
- **Machine-readable metadata:** each transcript has a `.json` sidecar
  (title, `started_at`, `duration_min`, `participants`, `source`, filename),
  and `index.jsonl` in the folder lists every meeting, one JSON object per
  line, append-only.
- The folder deliberately lives in `~/Documents`, not `~/Library` — macOS
  lets you grant AI tools access there. Transcripts recorded before this
  layout were copied in automatically; the originals stay where they were.

For deeper access (search across all sessions from an agent), the app also
bundles an MCP server — see Settings → General → Agent access.

## Status

- **Phase 0 (Recon): DONE** — see `findings.md`. Recommendation: build the coach **in-process (plugin / Tauri-event consumer), not a sidecar**, because the live transcript exists only as an in-process Tauri event stream.
- **Phase 1 (Offline simulator): next** — the de-risk step. Build the offline loop + backtest harness in `simulator/` before touching audio.

## Anarlog

The anarlog fork is not vendored into this repo yet. Add it as a submodule when starting Phase 2:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/fastrepl/anarlog.git anarlog
```
