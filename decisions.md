# Decisions log

Why choices were made — append-only, newest last. One short entry per
decision: what was decided and the reason that would otherwise be lost.
Agents: append here when a non-obvious choice is made (or reversed);
never rewrite old entries — supersede them with a new one.

## 2026-07-20 — Zero-config pivot
Repositioned as a live Granola alternative: transcript + ambient stats
primary, default nudges cut ~20→5, config behind an Advanced disclosure.
Why: nudge volume read as nagging in real use; transcript value landed
immediately with zero setup.

## 2026-07-28 — Speaker names are never auto-applied
LLM name suggestions require a one-tap confirm. Why: a wrong name gets
saved with a voice profile and poisons every future session's enrollment.

## 2026-07-28 — Voice profiles stored at 16kHz
Audio is FIR-decimated 48k→16k at the capture boundary. Why: the LS-EEND
model runs at 16kHz natively, so higher rates only cost memory (3×) and
internal resampling — verified zero quality loss (voice band unity gain,
aliasing −52dB).

## 2026-07-29 — Referral codes are one shared code, counted locally
`coachfree` on AppSumo, 3 invites tracked on-device, never enforced.
Why: no backend exists (local-first constraint); scarcity drives sharing
but blocking generosity would be user-hostile. Unique per-user codes need
an API — revisit only if attribution becomes worth running a service.

## 2026-07-30 — End-of-meeting veto is capped at 45s (dual mode only)
Room speech used to veto the auto-stop forever — a TV near the mic kept a
session recording (and transcribing the TV) a minute past the call,
because the junk speech itself blocked every stop (Nick's 2026-07-29
report). MeetingEndArbiter now stops after 45s of sustained end evidence
regardless of mic-side speech. Mic-only sessions keep the unlimited veto:
they have no Screen Recording, so no window evidence corroborates the
end, and a muted participant listening via speakers→mic would be cut off.
45s = 2× the longest post-release goodbye observed before the veto
existed.

## 2026-07-30 — Transcripts save as coalesced turns, not raw utterances
The far side commits in 1-3 word fragments (William corpus: median 4
words, 40% of Them lines ≤3 words), so saved files were unreadable next
to Granola's export even though the PANE coalesces. saveSession and the
LLM-review prompt now run TurnBuilder over the utterance record (fixed
corpus: median 26 words, 5% tiny lines, word accuracy unchanged). Raw
utterances still drive signals and diarization — only the human/LLM-facing
renders changed.

## 2026-07-30 — Parakeet commits are sentence-aware
A silence gap only commits the window when the partial ends in terminal
punctuation; otherwise the window holds up to 3× the gap (window cap
still bounds it). Why: meeting apps noise-gate the remote stream
mid-thought, and committing on those gaps produced context-free 1-3 word
transcriptions ("rived" for "riveted"). Parakeet punctuates reliably, so
a missing terminator is strong mid-sentence evidence. Partials stream to
the UI regardless — only commit timing changed.

## 2026-07-30 — Ship scorecard on every push and release, informational
Noah wants the benchmark comparison IN FRONT of him before anything
ships, every time. bench/scorecard.py renders one report — transcription
accuracy + Them turn shape per committed corpus (vs bench/asr-history
.jsonl) and nudge quality (vs bench/history.jsonl) — printed by push-gate
stage 4 (which records fresh ASR scores) and rendered into the CI gate's
job summary on every release run. Kept informational (WARN, not block):
real-session numbers move for non-code reasons, and the existing stage-4
philosophy already settled that; the point is visibility, not automation.
Fragmentation (median words/line, % tiny lines) was added to the recorded
schema so the 2026-07-29 regression class shows up as a trend, not an
anecdote.

## 2026-07-30 — Vocabulary fixes are a post-ASR dictionary, not model work
Parakeet takes no contextual hints, so known-term garbles ("app sumo",
"Tidy Khắc Việt", "epsom") are repaired by VocabularyNormalizer after
transcription; SFSpeech gets the same terms as contextualStrings. One
user-editable list (Advanced → Vocabulary) drives both. Built-in defaults
carry only observed garbles narrow enough that ordinary English never
matches — "utc" → UGC was explicitly rejected (real timezone, said in
real meetings); users who want it add `UGC = utc` themselves. Vietnamese
diacritics fold to ASCII only for words carrying Vietnamese-specific
codepoints — Western names (Mbappé, Dembélé) pass through untouched.

## 2026-07-30 — Gate streamlined by cutting ritual, not tests
Noah asked whether the push pipeline had grown too heavy. Answer: the
suites stay (each blocking suite is sub-minute or guards transcription
quality — the product); the ritual goes. Three changes: docs/markdown-
only pushes short-circuit to the changelog check (site pages and
redemption-code batches were paying ~4 min of build+audio for files no
code touches); stage 1 runs xcodegen itself (kills the stale-.xcodeproj
failure class); stage 4 auto-commits its benchmark records (the manual
"Gate benchmark record" commit is gone — records ride along with the
next push). Balance principle going forward: new checks join existing
suites rather than becoming new ones; no new recorded metrics unless
they would change a ship decision.

## 2026-07-30 — Transcript words are click-to-fix via invisible links
Noah's ask: click the misheard word itself, don't retype it. SwiftUI's
Text can't report which word was clicked, so every word carries an
mcfix:// link styled as plain text and an OpenURLAction routes the click
to the fix popover with the word pre-filled (focus jumps to "should be").
Chosen over per-word subviews (hundreds of turns × dozens of words would
wreck the pane's rendering budget) and over NSTextView rows (heavyweight,
sizing quirks). Right-click stays for multi-word phrases. Vocabulary
management moved from the sidebar Advanced list to Settings → General —
it's set-and-forget, not per-call.

## 2026-07-30 — Synthetic hard-conversation ASR fixture is a trend, not a gate
`tests/asr/hard.sh` runs a ~2-min scripted two-speaker stress case
(tight handoffs, backchannels, proper nouns, numbers, 155–210 wpm) and
appends WER to `bench/asr-history.jsonl` (corpus `synthetic-hard`).
Why non-blocking: unlike the conv/silence/cut/long gates it is built to
be hard, so its absolute WER is meaningless — only movement across
commits matters. Same generated audio every run means any movement is
the code, unlike the real-meeting corpus where Zoom's own errors and new
meetings confound the number.

## 2026-08-03 — Launch at login: default on, register release builds only
Noah's ask: the app should be running again after a restart. Toggle in
Settings → General → Startup, backed by SMAppService.mainApp; default
on, applied once when the pref is first unset (existing users get it on
their first launch after updating), then only on explicit toggle — never
re-applied every launch, so turning the item off in System Settings →
Login Items is respected instead of fought. Registration is compiled out
of Debug builds: dev and installed app share bundle ID + UserDefaults,
so a dev build registering itself would point the login item at the
Debug build path and hijack the installed app's registration.

## 2026-08-04 — Model downloads start at launch, sequential, Parakeet first
Noah: "do what's best for the person" — both models now download with zero
clicks. Kick-off lives in the menu bar label's onAppear (the only
always-alive view, so login/menu-bar-only launches fetch too). Sequential
on purpose: Parakeet (~600 MB) is the core product — transcription IS the
first-session value, the LLM only upgrades nudges which have a
deterministic fallback — and parallel multi-GB pulls halve each other's
bandwidth. If Parakeet fails, the LLM pull is skipped that launch (a link
that can't do 600 MB can't do 6.6 GB); a successful Retry still chains it.

## 2026-08-04 — Auto-LLM pull: attempted-flag set at pull start only
The once-only `autoModelPullAttempted` flag is written the moment a pull
genuinely starts, not when the attempt is evaluated. An engine that can't
come up (dev build without the vendored runtime) logs and retries next
launch — that's not a user decision. A user Cancel after a real start is
one, and is never re-fought. Low-disk (<12 GB free) also defers without
setting the flag.

## 2026-08-04 — Referral prompt moved to the 2nd meeting
First-meeting ask landed mid-first-impression (Noah). New
`referralCompletedMeetingCount` increments on real non-empty sessions;
the sheet fires at >= 2, still once ever. The legacy Bool key
(`referralFirstSessionPromptShown`) stays as the shown-gate — it also
grandfathers everyone who already saw the prompt under the old rule. The
counter seeds itself from saved session files on first read so existing
users' history counts.

## 2026-08-04 — Granola import: meeting-date filenames + header dedupe marker
Imported sessions are ordinary session_yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm.md files stamped
with the meeting's ORIGINAL date — the filename is the only date the
dashboard/search parsers read, so imports sort into history correctly with
zero parser changes. Filename collisions bump forward one minute (a suffix
would make the file invisible to the parsers). Dedupe is an
`**Imported-From:** granola:<id>` header line (ignored by every parser);
re-import skips matching ids. Notes bodies are sanitized (checkboxes
`- [ ]` → `- ☐`, `## ` headings demoted) so task lists can't parse as
transcript lines and a "Nudges" heading can't trip the nudge counter.
Docs with no resolvable date are skipped and counted — a wrong date in a
date-keyed archive is worse than absence. Granola v6+ encrypts the cache:
that surfaces as a clear error plus a file-import fallback for Granola
exports.

## 2026-08-04 — Demo demoted from empty-state centerpiece to footer link
Noah: demo-as-centerpiece was "kind of confusing" as onboarding. The empty
main pane is now a live checklist (permissions with grant buttons, both
model downloads with real progress, "join a meeting", privacy line);
the demo survives as a caption link. The first-launch WelcomeSheet keeps
the demo as the aha moment — only the persistent empty state changed.

## 2026-08-04 — Granola import is CSV-only
Noah's call while live-testing the onboarding branch: one button, one
format. The cache-scrape path (cache-v3.json) and the markdown-file
fallback are gone — the user enables data export in Granola and picks the
CSV here. Rationale: newer Granola encrypts the cache anyway (the primary
path was already dead on current installs, surfacing as the red error in
testing), and two buttons + a fallback that appears after a failure is
onboarding noise. Columns are matched by name, not position (Granola owns
the format); dedupe markers stay `granola:<id>` so pre-CSV imports don't
duplicate; id-less rows fall back to `granola-csv:<title>@<iso-date>`.

## 2026-08-04 — Coach rail can never be narrower than a nudge card
The live-session right rail clipped ALL its content on both sides at
narrow widths (Noah hit it on first branch test). Cause: NudgeCardView's
badge row uses .fixedSize() so the card's minimum width (~315pt with the
timestamp gutter) exceeded the rail's 200pt minWidth — SwiftUI centers
the overflowing ScrollView content, clipping every card in the rail,
review included. Fix: rail minWidth 200 → 280 (the card's real floor) and
the scope hint ("· last 5 min") may truncate; the type badge keeps its
never-fold guarantee.

## 2026-08-04 — How to simulate a "new user" for onboarding tests
Faking $HOME does NOT work on this macOS: UserDefaults (cfprefsd),
homeDirectoryForCurrentUser, AND urls(for:.applicationSupportDirectory)
all resolve the real account home and ignore the env var (verified
empirically — three separate leaks found this way). Working recipe:
argument-domain defaults overrides at launch (`-hasSeenDemo NO
-autoModelPullAttempted NO -sessionFolderPath <empty dir>`), rename the
real model stores aside (`FluidAudio/Models`,
`MeetingCoach/ollama/manifests` → `.pretest`), and run a scratch
`ollama serve` (the installed bundle's binary) with OLLAMA_MODELS at an
empty dir so the app adopts an engine with zero models. TCC rows
(mic/Screen Recording) cannot be faked per-launch — they're keyed to the
bundle. Restore = rename back, kill scratch engine.

## 2026-08-04 — Row bindings in editable lists are id-keyed, never positional
A user crash report (0.10.1, `Array._checkSubscript` via
`Binding.subscript.getter` under `SystemTextField`) exposed that the
element bindings `ForEach($array)` vends read `array[index]` positionally
on every access: delete a row while one of its TextFields has a pending
edit and the next layout pass indexes past the end — hard crash. All three
editable-row lists (pre-call participants, custom rubric rows, Settings
vocabulary) now go through `Binding.safeElement(_:)`
(Views/SafeElementBinding.swift), which resolves the element by id — reads
of a deleted row return its last value, writes no-op. The vocabulary
screen was the likeliest crash site: its `.onChange(of: vocabularyText)`
sync rebuilds `vocabEntries` wholesale and `parseVocab` drops
term-less rows, so the transcript fix-flow writing to the same store could
shrink the array mid-edit with no user action. `builtinRows` keeps plain
bindings — that list never shrinks. Rule: any ForEach whose array can
shrink while a row control is focused must use id-keyed bindings.

## 2026-08-04 — Vocabulary saves get visible feedback
Vocab rows persist on every keystroke but did so silently, and rows
missing "Corrected to…" are silently skipped by serialization — Noah
couldn't tell whether an added term saved at all. The section now shows a
transient green "Saved" label when an edit actually reaches storage, and
an orange "Fill in 'Corrected to…' to save the row" hint when a row won't
serialize. Matches the RubricBuilder footer's existing green-checkmark
saved idiom.

## 2026-08-04 — Verify on CI's toolchain before tagging (Xcode gap)
The v0.11.1 release failed twice at the tag: CI pins Xcode 16.2
(Swift 6 strict concurrency on the macOS 15.2 SDK) while local Macs run
Xcode 17 (macOS 26 SDK, View fully @MainActor) — code can build clean
locally and still fail the release gate. Lesson applied: `Binding`
get/set closures formed in nonisolated helpers need Sendable captures on
the old SDK (fix: @MainActor on the helper), and hand-rolled `Task {}` in
nonisolated View methods breaks the same way (prefer `.task(id:)`).
Process rule: after any Swift change that touches concurrency or new
helpers, dispatch "Test Gate" on main (workflow_dispatch) and wait for
green BEFORE pushing the tag — a failed release run means deleting and
re-pushing the tag. The gate's failure output now shows real `error:`
lines and uploads build.log as an artifact.

## 2026-08-04 — Dorado redesign: deviations from the design handoff
Built option 2a pixel-close, with five deliberate deviations: SF Symbols
instead of Font Awesome (README allowed the codebase's icon set); the
0.11.0 onboarding checklist stays as the zero-sessions state (a shipped
feature beats the spec's "single centered line"); light-only appearance
forced (the design has no dark variant — revisit if users complain);
live/post-session rail controls reuse the proven LiveSection because the
handoff explicitly left the live state undesigned ("ask before
inventing"); and — per Noah's review — home is the restyled Your
Progress dashboard, not an auto-opened session (the handoff killed the
stats pane, Noah wants it as "the main thing"). Fonts are bundled TTFs
registered via ATSApplicationFontsPath with a folder-type resource
reference — flat resource files silently never register.

## 2026-08-04 — CSV parsing in Swift: CRLF is ONE Character
Granola's export terminates its header with CRLF and body rows with LF.
Swift's Character is a grapheme cluster, so "\r\n" matches neither a
"\r" nor a "\n" switch case — the hand-rolled CSV parser glued the whole
file into one row and the importer rejected real exports as "not a
Granola CSV". Any future character-wise text scanning needs an explicit
"\r\n" case (see GranolaImporter.parseCSV). Locked by tests/granola.

## 2026-08-05 — Meeting reviews are chief-of-staff notes, not recaps
Noah compared the review card to Caitlin's hand-written Slack notes and
called it useless. Root causes and the calls made: (1) selectedModel can
point at a model that never finished downloading — every LLM feature
silently degraded; LLM calls now go through settings.effectiveModel
(selection if installed, else first installed). (2) The review prompt now
demands headline-first TL;DR, takeaways with specifics, and
"Owner — action — deadline" steps, explicitly BANS coach-mode outside the
one focus line (gemma4:e4b otherwise lectures about talk time), and
carries an inline example — the single thing that makes a 4B model hold
the section shape. (3) MeetingReview.parse tolerates renamed headers and
drops preambles rather than fighting the model. (4) Transcript budget
8K → 24K chars — the old cap amputated the middle where decisions live.
Ceiling note: reviews only know what was SAID; the next level is feeding
pre-call context + prior sessions with the same person.

## 2026-08-05 — Dark palette is invented, tokens are dynamic pairs
The design handoff only drew light. Dark mode = same hierarchy on
near-black (#1E2126 surface), accents unchanged except Bolt lightened
(#5B9BFF) for contrast; every Dorado token is a light/dark NSColor pair
resolved at draw time. The app follows the system (forced-light removed).

## 2026-08-05 — Check core.hooksPath before trusting "gate green"
The local push gate never ran this session: core.hooksPath was unset on
this clone (likely lost in a re-clone/sync), so pushes skipped the gate
silently and CI's release gate caught a broken test stub instead. The
ASR suites don't run on CI at all — so a bad transcription change could
have shipped. Rule: verify `git config core.hooksPath` returns
scripts/githooks at the start of any session that will push.

## 2026-08-05 — RAM-aware models: one fit formula, hide (don't disable), warm at launch

A model "fits" when weights + ~1.5 GB (KV/runner) stay within ~70% of
unified memory (`ModelMemory` in OllamaClient.swift); every catalog
`minRAMGB` was derived from that same formula, and non-catalog installed
models use it directly on their on-disk size. Chosen because the failure
mode of "almost fits" is not an error but a whole-machine swap freeze —
so the line is drawn with meeting headroom (Zoom + browser + Parakeet),
not at bare load-ability. Catalog models that don't fit are *hidden*
(Noah's call) rather than shown-disabled, with a one-line footnote so
the shorter list is explainable. Default is RAM-tiered: qwen3.5:9b only
on 32 GB+, qwen3.5:4b otherwise. effectiveModel now also skips
installed-but-oversized selections (largest fitting model wins) with an
orange banner instead of a silent swap-storm. The model preloads at app
launch via /api/generate keep_alive=2h (re-warmed at session start and
after downloads): mmap'd weights are file-backed and reclaimable, so
residency is cheap, and load time moves off minute-one of a call — the
worst possible moment. Warm-up doubles as the memory preflight: Ollama's
own OOM message is surfaced in Settings instead of discovered mid-call.

## 2026-08-05 — Deleted the code behind the hidden entry points (rubric builder, transcript-drop)

Commit f336099 (2026-07-24, "transcript upload and Coaching Style entry
points hidden") removed the UI doors but left ~1,100 lines shipping
unreachable: CoachingStyleSection → RubricBuilderView +
RubricBuilderViewModel, and TranscriptSection → SimulationTimelineView +
SimulationViewModel + CoachingCall (loadTranscript had its only call
site inside the dead section; no onDrop existed anywhere). Deleted all
of it rather than leaving "maybe later" code: three releases shipped
without the doors and nobody missed them, and git history is the
archive — `git log -S CoachingStyleSection` finds everything if a
rubric-builder v2 ever returns. The rubric *system* (YAML, active.yaml,
round-trip, migration) is untouched; only the builder UI died.
FeedbackSection (Coaching Notes) kept its feature but now owns
feedbackText/feedbackSaved as @State instead of borrowing the dead
SimulationViewModel. Also dropped: three zero-reference funcs
(splitWords, VoiceProfileStore.allNames, Dorado.sectionLabel) and the
empty coach//overlay/ placeholder dirs from the original PLAN phases.

## 2026-08-06 — Mic capture survives input-device changes (notification + watchdog, restart forever)

Noah handed a live phone call to his Mac mid-session ("From Your
iPhone") and MeetingCoach kept saying "Listening" while transcribing
nothing: AVAudioEngine stops permanently when the default input device
changes (`AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange`), and nothing restarted it.
Recovery is two-layered on purpose: the notification is the documented
signal, but a 3s watchdog on buffer arrival backstops it — a running
engine delivers buffers continuously (silence included), so a quiet tap
is proof of death even if the notification never fires. Restart builds
a fresh engine rather than reusing the stopped one (the input node's
format/device binding is stale) and retries forever with capped backoff
instead of giving up: a call handoff can hold the mic for several
seconds, and "comes back whenever a device does" beats a dead session.
The pipelines are deliberately NOT restarted — Parakeet resamples per
buffer and SFSpeech reads each buffer's format, so transcript state
survives the swap; the mic-only diarizer gets the dead gap backfilled
with silence because its clock is fed-audio-relative. stop() tears the
mic down inside the restart queue so an in-flight recovery can't
resurrect the engine after the session ends.

## 2026-08-05 — Continuity call handoff: pin the built-in mic, ignore self-inflicted config changes

The 0.15.0 device-change recovery rebuilt capture on "the new device" —
but a phone call handed to the Mac makes the iPhone's Continuity mic
(transport 'ccwd'/'ccwl') the system DEFAULT input, and that device
delivers silent buffers to every app but the call. Rebuilding onto it
is indistinguishable from working (buffers flow, watchdog happy,
"Listening" shown) while transcribing nothing — Noah's 2026-08-05
report. Fix: when the default input is a Continuity capture device,
pin the AUHAL to the Mac's built-in mic (kAudioOutputUnitProperty_
CurrentDevice), pre-start plus a post-start read-back re-assert
(start() can silently undo a pre-start pin). Hard-won detail: pinning
away from the default makes AVAudioEngine post a config change for
ITSELF — rebuilding on that notification spiraled into a rebuild storm
(~10/s). The notification handler now ignores config changes while the
engine is still running on the chosen device; genuinely dead capture is
still caught (isRunning false, or the 5s buffer watchdog). We do NOT
change the system default input back — a user may have deliberately
chosen the iPhone mic for another app (Continuity Camera), and the
call itself may be using it. Also: mclog now reopens its file handle
when /tmp/mc_debug.log vanishes — a deleted log left long-running apps
writing to the unlinked inode, which is why today's live bug report
had no log evidence.

## 2026-08-06 — LLM memory: warm around meetings, not at launch; smallest-sufficient model, not largest

Field data (Noah, 32 GB Mac, live call): llama-server 7.19 GB resident,
app 16.4% CPU, and the 60s semantic heartbeat made 62 LLM passes over a
72-min call with every one returning zero calls. Three reversals/fixes:

1. **Warm-on-detect replaces warm-at-launch** (reverses part of
   2026-08-05). The launch warm-up's justification ("mmap'd weights are
   file-backed and reclaimable, so residency is cheap") missed that KV
   cache + compute buffers are dirty anonymous memory macOS cannot
   reclaim — multi-GB pinned for 2h on a Mac not in any meeting. The
   original problem (model load at minute one of a call = freeze) stays
   solved: the meeting-detection pill fires the warm-up, so the model is
   resident before the user even clicks Start. startLive re-warms as a
   no-op backstop (hand-started sessions, engine restarts). After the
   post-call review the model is explicitly unloaded (keep_alive 0,
   guarded by /api/ps so an unloaded model is never loaded just to
   unload it); app quit evicts models from an adopted system engine too
   (stop() previously no-op'd there, leaving 7 GB pinned after quit).

2. **effectiveModel fallback prefers the RAM-tiered recommendation,
   then the smallest fitting install** (was: largest fitting). The
   "largest that fits" rule silently overrode recommendedCatalogModel's
   whole point — a 24 GB Mac with gemma4:e4b (9.6 GB) lying around ran
   it instead of the intended qwen3.5:4b (3.4 GB). An explicit
   user selection that fits is still always honored.

3. **KV memory is now configured, not defaulted.** Spawned engine gets
   OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 (the app is strictly one-request-at-a-time; the
   auto default allocates KV per slot), OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1,
   OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 + OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0 (~halves KV).
   In-call clients (SemanticCoach, SpeakerNameInference) request
   num_ctx 4096 — their prompt is a 180s window — while the post-call
   review keeps 8192 for long transcripts; the one runner respawn this
   causes lands post-call, when it's harmless. preload() now sends the
   same options as generation: a mismatched num_ctx made Ollama respawn
   the runner on the first real call, double-paying the load the
   warm-up existed to save. Generation requests carry keep_alive
   explicitly (10m) — they used to silently reset the server default
   (5m), making actual residency an accident of whichever request came
   last.

CPU (same batch): heartbeat gates on conversation change (skip when <3
new utterances since last pass; empty passes stretch the interval
60→90→120s, any fired nudge snaps back to 60 — worst case one stretched
beat of extra latency on a signal that stays in the 180s window);
Parakeet partial refresh throttles on long windows (every 2nd tick >12s,
3rd >22s — commit checks still run every tick, so transcript/test-visible
commit timing is unchanged); RMS loops moved to vDSP; mclog's NSLog is
DEBUG-only and off the calling thread (it was a synchronous
unified-logging round-trip per utterance on audio-adjacent threads).
Deferred, evidence-gathered but not done: FluidAudio streaming decoder
(fresh TdtDecoderState per pass re-transcribes the whole window today),
incremental applyDiarization/turn rebuild, SCK audio-only capture,
event-driven idle meeting detection (2s CoreAudio poll), coalescing the
per-utterance + 5s signal evaluations. corespeechd CPU during Noah's
call was NOT MeetingCoach (session log shows pure Parakeet) — likely
Live Captions or the meeting app's own captions.

## 2026-08-06 — Apple calls become first-class meetings; silence warning stops blaming the room

Customer report + Noah repro (relayed iPhone call, "From Your iPhone"):
no detection pill, one utterance, then "Meeting ended? No speech
detected" while 30+ minutes of call went untranscribed. Root causes and
choices:

1. **The com.apple.* mic-holder filter was hiding every phone call.**
   The filter exists so Siri/dictation/Voice Memos never look like
   meetings — correct — but FaceTime and iPhone-relayed cellular calls
   are also com.apple.*. Fix: a narrow allowlist (FaceTime, Phone,
   avconferenced, callservicesd) through the filter, same IDs added to
   meetingBundlePrefixes. The exact mic-holding process for relayed
   calls varies by macOS version and could not be verified live (Noah's
   call kept its audio on the iPhone — no Mac process ever held call
   audio, confirmed via CoreAudio process-object probe during the call),
   so detection also logs each unrecognized Apple mic holder once per
   run: the field names the daemon for us. Daemons can't false-positive
   the pre-14.4 fallback (NSWorkspace.runningApplications never lists
   them). FaceTime call windows (owner "FaceTime", title ≠ "FaceTime")
   count as meeting-window evidence and title the session with the
   caller's name.

2. **A call answered on the iPhone is UNFIXABLE capture** — the Mac has
   no audio path (probe: default input/output stayed iMac mic/speakers,
   zero call processes doing audio IO). The only correct behavior is
   honesty: the 3-minute silence card now distinguishes "transcript
   flowed then stopped" (Meeting ended?) from "transcript never started"
   (≤3 utterances → "Can't hear this meeting — call audio may be on
   your iPhone or headset; take it on this Mac or speakerphone").
   Threshold is utterance count, not audio energy: faint across-the-desk
   speech still commits occasional fragments, so energy alone can't
   separate the cases.

3. **Bleed gate required a loud speaker to justify a drop.** The gate
   dropped any mic utterance after 3s of mic quiet — but bleed is by
   definition speaker leakage; with the system channel silent for 6s+
   there is nothing to leak, and the drop was deleting real-but-faint
   near speech (the across-the-desk call case). Now: drop only when the
   system side was recently loud (new lastLoudSystemAt, floor 0.002).

4. **Mid-session SCK death now flips micOnly.** stream(didStopWithError)
   only emitted a status string; isMicOnly stayed false, so the arbiter
   kept the dual-mode 45s end cap (losing mic-only's unlimited veto) and
   echo suppression kept filtering against a dead channel. New
   onSystemAudioLost callback sets session.micOnly = true.

Also confirmed in the same probe: corespeechd CPU belongs to
com.apple.CoreSpeech holding the mic system-wide (Siri/Live Captions),
not to MeetingCoach.

## 2026-08-06 — Session titles from the review LLM; machine titles are the only ones it may replace

The word-frequency titler can only see which words recur, not what was
decided — it titled today's team meeting after the person being FIRED
("Steinberg · flow & email"). The post-call review already reads the
whole meeting, so it now leads with a TITLE: section (format verified
against qwen3.5:9b on a real transcript before shipping) and the app
adopts it. The precedence trick: there is no provenance recorded for
titles, but machine titles are REPRODUCIBLE — if the current header
title equals what TranscriptSearch.suggestedTitle would produce for the
same content, the sidebar heuristic wrote it and upgrading loses
nothing; anything else (user rename, window/caller title, pre-call
person·subject, the bare-Title cleared sentinel) was chosen by a human
or a real meeting name and always wins. This also resolves the race
where the sidebar writes its heuristic title seconds after save, long
before the LLM review finishes.

Operational, learned twice now (v0.15.0, v0.17.0): pushing a tag does
NOT trigger the Release workflow on this repo — the tag arrives but no
run is created. Ship via Actions → Release → Run workflow (version
input attaches to the existing tag). Root cause still unknown.
[CORRECTED 2026-08-09 — this was a myth; see the autopsy below.]

## 2026-08-09 — Tag-push "doesn't trigger releases" was a myth

Autopsy from GitHub's own records (run list + events feed): every tag
ever pushed from a normal user credential triggered the Release
workflow — v0.8.0 through v0.14.0, AND v0.15.0 (push-triggered run at
20:48Z on Aug 5, right after the lesson was first "learned"), AND
v0.16.0 (pushed the day the lesson was re-recorded). The two "failures"
were something else entirely:

- v0.15.0: the tag was pushed from a REMOTE Claude session whose
  credentials 403'd — the tag never reached GitHub, so of course no run
  appeared. Once pushed from a real machine, it triggered normally.
- v0.17.0: no tag was ever pushed (events feed shows zero tag-push
  events that day). Believing the v0.15.0 lore, the operator went
  straight to workflow_dispatch — and that run CREATES the tag itself
  via action-gh-release using GITHUB_TOKEN, which GitHub deliberately
  exempts from triggering further workflows (recursion guard). The
  absence of a push-run was the system working as designed.

The real rule: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` from a
machine with user credentials works and is the primary path (AGENTS.md
was right all along). workflow_dispatch is the fallback for remote
sessions that can't push tags. Nothing to fix in the workflow.

## 2026-08-09 — Apple calls: SCK cannot hear call audio → mic-only

Field reports twice in two days (Noah's FaceTime; Ned Donovan's email:
"it said I talked 100% of the time, but I talked the least"): on a
FaceTime call taken on the Mac, the far side never transcribes. Root
cause: macOS renders FaceTime/Phone audio through the privacy-protected
call path (avconferenced) that ScreenCaptureKit cannot capture — the
SCK stream starts cleanly and delivers digital silence for the call.
Dual mode then fails three ways at once: the "Them" pipeline never
speaks; the bleed gate never arms (it requires a recently-loud system
channel); the echo filter's far-text pool stays empty. Net effect: the
far side leaking speakers → mic is transcribed and labeled "You" —
the app hears the whole call and attributes every word to the user.
That is how "100% talk time" happens to the quietest person on the
call, with no banner (the capture-gap card only fires when the
transcript never starts, and here it flows continuously).

Decision: when an Apple call daemon (appleCallBundleIDs) holds the mic
at session start, skip SCK entirely and run the mic-only path — label
"Meeting", mic diarizer splits the room into Speaker 1/2/enrolled
names. On speakers this captures BOTH sides correctly attributed; on
headphones it captures only the user, and a dedicated orange card
("Call detected — listening through your Mac's mic") says the fix is
speakers, not a permission — replacing the misleading "grant Screen
Recording" banner for this case. This also answers Ned's "tell it what
my output is" ask: no output setting can help; capture is impossible.

Deliberately NOT done: (a) mid-session flip when a call starts after
Go Live — the mic pipeline's "You" label and diarizer clock make a
live swap messy, and every reported case starts the session from the
call's detection pill; logged-only for now. (b) Core Audio process
taps (macOS 14.4+ AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap) as a way to actually
capture call audio — worth an experiment someday, but unverifiable
without a live call and may be privacy-blocked for the call path too.
Scenario 5 of tests/calls-manual.md now records the evidence to revisit.

ADDENDUM, same day, after live testing on a real FaceTime call (Noah +
Mafe, ~15 min, RMS telemetry added to the mic tap): the mic-only
strategy is DEAD for calls taken on the Mac. macOS hard-walls the
microphone from every other client while FaceTime/Phone owns it — not
attenuates: pure digital zeros. Measured: plain AUHAL client, 3ch,
zeros; VPIO client (voice-processing mode, 7ch), zeros; rebuild after
rebuild via the new zero-audio watchdog, zeros. Audio flowed perfectly
until the instant the call connected (the transcript caught "I'm
calling you again. Should I answer?" and went silent on the answer).
The two brief exceptions earlier (peak RMS 0.0063–0.027, single words
committed) rode transient 1ch device states FaceTime itself created —
not requestable. So: no capture strategy exists for Mac-taken calls;
speakers vs headphones is irrelevant; Ned's "tell it my output" ask
can't help. Final behavior: detect the call (start-time AND
mid-session via the zero-audio watchdog + daemon check), skip SCK,
show the truth card with real workarounds (iPhone speakerphone near
the Mac — that mic path works and is already handled — or a meeting
app). Kept: the call-mode low voice floor (0.0012) — harmless, and it
catches words if a transient whisper state ever appears; the
zero-audio watchdog doubles as general dead-mic recovery and brings
capture back the moment a call ends. VPIO experiment reverted.
Process-tap exploration remains the only open thread for real capture.

## 2026-08-10 — Menu-bar red dot for pending updates rides on a non-template icon

Added a CleanShot-style red dot on the menu bar icon while a Sparkle
update is pending, plus an "Update Available — Install…" item at the
top of the dropdown. The Sparkle popup is unchanged — the dot exists
because the popup is dismissible and then nothing reminds the user.
Mechanism: `UpdateBadgeModel` is the `SPUUpdaterDelegate`
(didFindValidUpdate sets, updaterDidNotFindUpdate clears — which also
covers "Skip This Version", since the next scheduled check reports
no update; installing clears by relaunch). Non-obvious part: macOS
strips ALL color from menu bar template images, so the badged state
hand-draws a non-template NSImage (glyph tinted white/black from
SwiftUI's colorScheme + a systemRed oval) while the normal state stays
a plain SF Symbol template. Cost of non-template: wallpaper-tinted
menu bars won't recolor the glyph — accepted, it only shows while an
update is pending. Debug hook to see it on demand:
`defaults write com.coach.MeetingCoach ForceUpdateBadge -bool true`.
Verified 2026-08-10 via window-scoped screenshot (dot renders red) and
AX menu dump (item present, first position).

## 2026-08-10 — Intel Macs: block CoreML models entirely, don't try to catch the crash

Customer crash report (0.17.0, iMac20,1): SIGFPE divide-by-zero inside
Apple's Espresso x86 CPU padding kernel, on CoreMLBatchProcessingQueue,
~28s after launch — the first real Parakeet/LS-EEND inference window.
FluidAudio's maintainer confirms the models were never validated on
Intel ("I don't think the models support Intel devices", issue #173).
Key constraint: SIGFPE is a signal, not a thrown error — no Swift
catch around `transcribe()`/`process()` can survive it, so recovery
in-place is impossible; the only defense is never starting inference.
Decision: one compile-time gate (`PlatformSupport.neuralModelsSupported`,
`#if arch(arm64)`) consulted at every model entry point — ParakeetEngine
(load + cached check), ParakeetDownloadState (skip the 600 MB download),
SpeakerDiarizer (start() marks itself stopped so enqueue drops audio
instead of growing a preload no model will read). Intel sessions run
SFSpeech with diarization off, and the UI says so honestly (onboarding
row, live banner, post-session review note, site FAQ) instead of
promising "next session will be better". Rejected: shipping arm64-only
(existing Intel customers would lose the app entirely) and runtime
input validation (the divide is inside Apple's kernel; no input shape
is documented safe on x86).

## 2026-08-10 — Updates install themselves; stale updates escalate at session end

A field report (friend on an M4 Air) traced "the app slows my computer"
to a pre-0.12.0 build still running the two-engine CPU bug a week after
the fix shipped — Sparkle only auto-checked, so a dismissed panel meant
staying stale indefinitely. Three changes: (1) SUAutomaticallyUpdate on
— updates download in the background and install at quit/reboot with no
click needed; (2) because a login-item menu-bar app can run for weeks
without quitting, an update pending 3+ days re-surfaces the Sparkle
panel when a session ends (never mid-call, once a day max) and the
menu-bar item escalates to "Update waiting N days"; (3) every launch now
logs "[App] MeetingCoach vX (build N) @ commit" — that field session had
to fingerprint the running version from log-line *ordering* because
nothing ever logged it. Rejected: force-relaunch after install-on-idle
(too aggressive for an app that may be mid-workday context) and nagging
on a timer (interrupts meetings; session end is the one natural pause).
Sparkle persists the master switch in UserDefaults, so the new
Settings → General → "Install updates automatically" toggle (on by
default) binds straight to updater.automaticallyDownloadsUpdates — no
parallel preference key to drift.

## 2026-08-11 — One-on-one remote alias is display-layer only, never a mutation
In a dual-channel one-on-one, "Them"-family labels alias to the sole
remote name (renamed voice > enrolled name > single pre-call participant)
via `LiveSessionViewModel.displaySpeaker`; stored utterance labels stay
raw. Why: when a second remote voice appears, dropping the alias reverts
every guessed label instantly with zero provenance tracking — a mutation
path would need to know which turns were aliased vs. diarizer-assigned
and un-relabel them. Explicit renames keep the existing mutation path;
saved files serialize through the same resolver (alias applied before
turn coalescing, so "Them"/"Them 1" fragments of one person merge under
their real name). Two or more distinct remote voices always show
numbered labels — never guess on a group call.

## 2026-08-11 — Deferred voice-profile saves, scoped to speakers named this session
Naming a speaker before 3s of clip exists keeps the name pending
(`PendingProfileSaves`, pure state in the diarizer); the save fires from
publish() when the clip crosses the minimum, with one refresh at stop
using the fullest clip (≤12s cap). Why: the early, most natural rename
("Them" → Caitlin in the first minute) used to silently save no profile.
Scope is ONLY slots the user named this session — enrolled profiles are
never auto-refreshed from session audio, because one misattributed
session (speaker bleed) would silently poison a good profile.

## 2026-08-11 — Post-stop rename rewrites only the saved file's `## Transcript` section
Accepted limitation: old labels inside nudge lines, the `## Review`
section, and the `**Participants:**` header line are not rewritten. Why:
those sections quote history (what the nudge/review actually said at the
time); splicing just the transcript keeps the rewrite atomic and the
title/review byte-identical.

## 2026-08-11 — One model per meeting: pin it, don't re-read it
`settings.effectiveModel` is computed over `availableModels`, and the recap
calls `refreshModels()` before generating. So every late read of it could
name a different model than the heartbeat actually loaded — a Settings
change mid-call or a refresh that alters what fits was enough. The recap
then loaded a second runner beside the resident one, and the unload that
follows freed whichever name it happened to resolve, leaving the other held
until keep_alive expired. Two multi-GB runners, and the cleanup missing.

`LiveSessionViewModel.activeSessionModel` is now pinned once at session start
and drives the heartbeat, name inference, the recap request, and the existing
`unloadIfLoaded()` call. The rule is that load, use, and unload must always
name the same model; nothing may re-read the preference mid-meeting. Reviews
re-run outside a session (session detail view) still fall back to
`effectiveModel`, since nothing was pinned for them.

Deliberately NOT done: sizing against *free* RAM at session start. Today's
`ModelMemory` sizes against physical RAM (70% budget + 1.5 GB), which cannot
see that another app is holding 20 GB right now — the case that started this
was a 32 GB Mac swapping with a model that passes the physical-RAM test. A
free-RAM check is the real remaining gap, but doing it honestly means
measuring after capture/Parakeet is initialized, which is a session-start
restructure rather than a constant. A guessed "capture reserve" constant was
prototyped and rejected: it double-counts the 30% ModelMemory already holds
back, and its value would have been invented rather than measured.

## 2026-08-11 — Size against free memory too, not just installed RAM
`ModelMemory.fits(_:)` asks whether a Mac COULD run a model: weights + 1.5 GB
inside 70% of physical RAM. It cannot see what is resident right now. The
incident that opened this thread was a 32 GB Mac swapping hard (28.5 GB used,
2.7 GB swap, 10.9 GB compressed) on qwen3.5:9b — minRAMGB 16, so it passes
that rule with room to spare, while a browser, a video call and two Electron
apps held the memory it needed.

So there are now two rules and a model must pass both. They are complementary,
not duplicated: the 70% rule reserves a fraction of TOTAL memory for the
machine's general needs, while the new check reserves headroom inside what is
actually free at this moment.

- `ModelMemory.availableGB` — free + inactive pages via host_statistics64,
  documented as a heuristic. Inactive pages are reclaimable, not free, and the
  number moves under us; compressed and purgeable pages are excluded rather
  than counted so the estimate does not inflate.
- Need = installed size + 1.5 GB KV/runner, taken from the installed list
  (refreshed first) rather than from a catalog guess.
- `currentHeadroomGB` = 3, for live capture (Parakeet, diarizer, buffers) plus
  growth over a meeting. Provisional and labelled as such — chosen
  conservatively, NOT measured, and wants calibration against a real session.
- Unsafe -> step down `recommendationLadder` to the best INSTALLED rung that
  fits. Never the largest that fits (same trap the 2026-08-06 effectiveModel
  fix removed), and never a rung that isn't downloaded — pulling gigabytes
  mid-meeting is worse than the fallback.
- Nothing fits -> `.deterministic`, and that decision is binding. It is a
  distinct case from "no session pinned anything" precisely so the recap —
  the heaviest call, running when memory is tightest — cannot quietly load
  the model session start refused.

Verified on the machine that produced the original freeze: 9.1 GB free, 9b
needs 8.0 + 3 = 11.0 (unsafe), 4b needs 4.8 + 3 = 7.8 (safe) -> steps to 4b.
Policy is pure and injectable, so the busy-32GB, 16GB and nothing-fits cases
are tested at exact pressures instead of depending on the test machine.

## 2026-08-11 — One session-model lifecycle, replacing three patched layers
The previous three passes (pin, then free-memory sizing, then "make it
authoritative") each patched the one before and left seams between them:
resolution ran before capture, warm-up was advisory, and cleanup was spread
across warm bookkeeping in SettingsViewModel plus an unload in the recap.
Replaced with a single lifecycle owned by LiveSessionViewModel.

State is exactly `preparing(id)` -> `deterministic(id)` | `pinned(id, model)`,
every case carrying the session UUID. Activation is one stored Task, started
after capture returns — so free memory is read with Parakeet and the diarizer
already resident rather than guessed at — and it refreshes the installed list,
reads the heuristic, selects with the 3 GB growth reserve, preloads that exact
model, and only then pins and starts coaching. Every continuation after an
await re-checks the UUID: Stop clears it and cancels the task, and a preload
that lands late is unloaded instead of pinned.

Anything short of a successful preload is deterministic: missing model,
unknown size, insufficient memory, engine failure, load failure. Nothing may
cold-load later, which is why no coach object is created in those cases — an
object is all a heartbeat needs to pull gigabytes in at minute one. Mock mode
is deterministic too and never constructs a real SemanticCoach.

Meeting-detection warm-up is gone. It guessed a model before capture was up,
so it could hold gigabytes for a meeting that never started, or load one the
session then rejected and had to unload. Correctness beat the preload latency
it bought. The only remaining non-session load is a post-download check in
Settings that a freshly pulled model runs at all.

`releaseSessionModel` is the single cleanup, called from all five exits:
normal recap, failed activation, empty session, cancellation, and a replaced
session. The recap may use only the pinned model — preparing or deterministic
gets the instant review, never effectiveModel — while session-detail review
stays independent and still uses the current effective model.

Four seams (memory read, preload, unload, review completion) default to the
live implementations and are substituted by the harness, so the races are
tested exactly rather than depending on the test machine's memory or a running
engine. The 3 GB reserve remains provisional and unmeasured.

## 2026-08-12 — Meeting language is an explicit session policy, not detection
Multilingual V1 defaults to “Mac language,” resolving the Mac's primary locale
exactly once when a meeting starts. An unsupported locale resolves to English
and Settings explains the fallback. This is intentionally not audio-language
detection: preserving known English quality and avoiding a silently wrong
language guess matter more than convenience in V1. A typed resolved-language
snapshot drives engine routing, cleanup, signals, review prompts, and the saved
ISO header, so changing the global picker cannot mutate a call already running.

English remains on Parakeet v2 and may start immediately with the existing
local SFSpeech fallback while v2 downloads. The other 24 supported European
languages use Parakeet v3 with its script hint, require Apple Silicon, and wait
for v3 rather than feeding non-English audio to an English fallback. v2 and v3
downloads serialize; passive Settings requests coalesce to the latest choice,
but a queued session-start waiter is never discarded. Both caches remain on
disk because eviction UI is outside V1.

## 2026-08-12 — Non-English mode keeps only language-independent evidence
The English deterministic suite depends on lexicons, punctuation, or discourse
shape in ways that are unsafe to generalize. Non-English sessions therefore run
exactly Talk Time, Voice Share, and Overrun. The semantic coach may still reason
over any transcript with a local model, but its protocol surface — JSON keys,
signal IDs, and nudge text — stays English.

Parakeet v3 output bypasses the Vietnamese-artifact fold at every session-bound
normalization path; otherwise legitimate Romanian `ă` and Croatian `đ` are
destroyed. Reviews put content in the snapshotted language while retaining the
five exact English headers required by the parser. Saved ISO codes reproduce
that policy during regeneration; sessions without a code (legacy and imports)
ask the model to follow the transcript's dominant language.

## 2026-08-12 — Capture readiness, not button press, starts the meeting clock
Non-English session start may wait minutes for the first Parakeet v3 download.
The capture manager now stamps its start only after engine selection succeeds,
before any pipeline is constructed, and the view model adopts that timestamp
for its wall clock and saved session time. This keeps pipeline-relative
utterance times and the visible session timer on the same zero point without
counting model setup as meeting time.

When a later session switches between Parakeet v2 and v3, the old FluidAudio
manager is cleaned up before the other model loads. It cannot serve the new
session because transcription already gates on the loaded version, and keeping
it alive only creates a two-model peak in memory.

## 2026-08-12 — Intel Macs always resolve to English (reverses the refusal)
The entry above shipped "non-English requires Apple Silicon and waits for v3
rather than refusing," which on Intel meant *refusing* — and because the
default selection is the Mac's language, any Intel Mac set to French, German,
Spanish, … would throw `multilingualRequiresAppleSilicon` on every Start with
no recovery except finding the Settings picker. Those users previously
transcribed fine on SFSpeech. Language resolution is now gated on
`PlatformSupport.neuralModelsSupported`: on Intel every selection resolves to
English, because Parakeet v3 cannot run there at all, so honoring the choice
buys the user nothing and costs them the app.

The override is silent in the transcript path but never silent in the UI:
`ResolvedMeetingLanguage.intelFallbackFrom` carries the language that was
wanted (kept separate from `selection`, which is `.system` — "Mac language" —
when the Mac locale supplied it), and Settings names it. The Apple Silicon
gate is injectable alongside the locale identifier so `tests/language` covers
both platforms from whichever machine runs the gate; the Intel guard in
`AudioCaptureManager.start()` is now unreachable and kept deliberately, since
its branch is the one that would otherwise feed non-English audio to an en-US
recognizer.

## 2026-08-13 — MeetMouse is a public rename, not an identity or data migration
The shipped product, app bundle filename, website, artwork, and MCP helper are
now MeetMouse. The Xcode target and scheme, bundle identifier
`com.coach.MeetingCoach`, Application Support and Documents directories, and
the existing public Sparkle feed remain unchanged internally. Keeping those
identifiers preserves macOS permissions, preferences, downloaded models,
transcripts, and the update chain for installed users. The app includes a
legacy `meetingcoach-mcp` helper alias alongside `meetmouse-mcp` so existing
agent configurations continue to work.

## 2026-08-13 — MeetMouse uses a literal animal, not an abstract logo
The approved visual direction is the first RhinoVoice-inspired concept: a
full-bodied charcoal-gray side-profile mouse on coral, rendered with chunky
3D/emoji-like character. The earlier flat front-facing mark felt generic. The
same principle applies in the menu bar, where Apple's literal `🐁` glyph is
more recognizable at 16 px than either the detailed raster or a custom mouse
outline. Status remains separate in small live, detection, update, and debug
dots. Coral replaces the previous yellow primary accent so the icon, app, and
site read as one brand.

## 2026-08-13 — Invalid microphone formats retry briefly, then fail cleanly

A 0.17.0 customer crash reached `AVAudioNode.installTap` while starting the
microphone. AVFAudio raises an Objective-C exception for a zero-channel input
format, so Swift `do/catch` cannot recover after the call. The capture boundary
now validates finite positive sample rate plus at least one channel before the
tap. Initial setup recreates the engine three times over 850 ms because Core
Audio commonly exposes zero channels transiently while a headset connects or
changes profiles; after that it surfaces the existing microphone-unavailable
error rather than waiting indefinitely or crashing. Mid-session recovery keeps
its existing independently backed-off rebuild loop.

## 2026-08-13 — v0.19.0 shipped with the known onReady/retry regression
Pre-ship review found that the multiversion rewrite of
`ParakeetDownloadState` walked back a documented contract: the old
`startIfNeeded` kept its `onReady` callbacks across a download failure so
that a Retry that succeeded still fired them; the new code consumes
completions on failure, so MenuBarLabel's chained recommended-LLM
auto-download silently never runs for the rest of the app session after
one transient network failure. Noah chose to ship anyway: the trigger is
narrow (first model download must fail), transcription is unaffected, and
it self-heals on the next launch because the chain re-arms at startup.
The fix (re-register surviving completions on failure, or have retry
re-enqueue them) is deliberately deferred to the next batch, not hotfixed.

## 2026-08-13 — Release mechanics: squash merge + cherry-picked changelog
0.19.0 went out through GitHub's squash-merge of PR #1 (Noah merged it in
the UI mid-session) rather than the usual fast-forward. The changelog and
gate benchmark-record commits landed after the squash, so they were
cherry-picked onto origin/main from a temp worktree and the tag was cut
there — never from the feature branch, whose pre-squash history no longer
matches main. Two gate gotchas discovered on the way, recorded in
HANDOFF Outstanding: Conductor clones don't inherit `core.hooksPath`, so
`git push` runs no gate at all; and the gate's docs-only short-circuit
diffs `@{u}..HEAD`, so once the code commits are pushed, a follow-up
changelog commit false-skips the full suite — unset the upstream to force
a real run before tagging.

## 2026-08-13 — Remote identity count requires transcript evidence

The one-on-one display alias now prefers remote labels that actually claimed
transcript utterances over every label in LS-EEND's audio timeline. Why: in a
real Noah/Chad 1:1, a stray second diarizer slot with no transcribed words made
the call look like a group, disabled the Chad alias, and rendered an unaligned
"Yeah." as raw `Them` beside correctly named Chad turns. A second label still
drops the alias as soon as it owns transcript speech, preserving honest group
calls; the full diarizer label set remains the fallback before any utterance
has been attributed. One veto survives from the old order: when transcript
evidence has only a numbered label but the diarizer heard ≥2 voices, the
rename/pre-call fallbacks are skipped — otherwise a group call whose
attribution lags the diarizer would display under the pre-call guess.

## 2026-08-13 — Basic mode is named, and a failed preload steps down
Reverses one clause of the silent-progressive-enhancement stance: a Mac
that *chose* no LLM (mock mode, kill-switch) still gets no ritual, but a
session that *degraded* into deterministic coaching now says so — an
orange "Coaching is in basic mode — low memory" banner in the transcript
pane and a compact orange line in the overlay's ambient state. Driven by
a real meeting on 2026-08-13: Noah sat six minutes with zero nudges on a
busy 32 GB Mac (7.4 GB free, nothing installed fit) with no way to tell
"working, nothing to say" from "coach never loaded". The notice lives in
`basicModeNotice` and is set only on degraded exits (memory, engine,
exhausted preloads), never on chosen ones.

Second change: activation no longer settles deterministic on the first
failed preload. `ModelMemory.candidatesForCurrentMemory` returns the
selection plus strictly *smaller* installed ladder rungs (never larger —
those would fail harder than the model that just OOMed), and activation
walks them in order. The 2026-08-11 invariant is untouched: all attempts
happen at session start inside the one activation task, every await
still re-checks the session UUID, and nothing may cold-load later.

Third (same session, Noah: "can we prompt that"): when the degradation is
memory and the ladder's smallest rung (granite4:3b, ~2.1 GB) isn't
installed, the banner offers a one-click download with inline progress.
The pull uses `downloadModel(_, forSessionFallback: true)`, which skips
two Settings-flow behaviors that would be wrong here: it does NOT switch
`selectedModel` (the rung is a fallback, not a preference — the ladder
finds it on its own), and it skips the post-pull verification load (the
user is mid-meeting on a machine that just proved it has no memory to
spare). The downloaded model is only ever picked up at a future session
start. If the smallest rung is already installed and still didn't fit,
no button — a download can't help.

## 2026-08-18 — AI coaching is a user choice, and a pressured Mac gets a 🐢 tip

Field complaint: "the app slows my computer." The measured cost is the LLM
(~7.2 GB resident; 62 heartbeat passes over a 72-min call producing zero
nudges — see 2026-08-06 entry), while transcription and tier-1 signals are
comparatively cheap. Noah's framing: transcript-first users should be able
to turn the AI off, run fast, and get the review after the call.

`semanticCoachEnabled` — until now an internal kill-switch — is surfaced in
the Model card as an "AI coaching" toggle (same defaults key, so existing
installs keep default-on). Off is a *chosen* mode and stays silent per the
basic-mode convention. It gates only the automatic LLM paths: session
activation and the one-time recommended-model auto-pull (flag left unset so
re-enabling restores the zero-click setup). Explicit actions — saved-session
"Generate AI review", note distillation — deliberately stay available: the
toggle means "no LLM unless I ask."

Discovery has three tiers, because the people who need it least read
settings the most: (1) a HelpDot on the toggle; (2) the low-memory basic-mode
banner gains "Turn off AI coaching" next to the small-model download; and
(3) a 🐢 memory-pressure tip for the common case neither catches — the model
*loaded fine* and is now squeezing the Mac. A DispatchSource memory-pressure
watcher runs only while a model is pinned (the tip claims the LLM's memory,
so it must only appear when the LLM is resident), plus an at-pin check
(<2 GB free after load). Post-call was rejected as the primary surface
(Noah: "post call most times is too late").

Accepting the tip sheds the model MID-CALL: pinned → deterministic, heartbeat
cancelled, model unloaded — memory back this call, not next session. This is
safe under the 2026-08-11 one-lifecycle invariant, which forbids cold-*loading*
mid-meeting, not unloading (recap already unloads mid-flow). "Keep it on" is
quiet for the session; three declines across sessions mute the tip forever.

## 2026-09-01 — AI-toolable transcripts folder (subfolder, new names, sidecars)

The default transcript location moves from the ~/Documents/MeetingCoach root
into its `transcripts/` subfolder, so the folder a user grants an AI tool
(Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) contains transcripts and nothing else — no rubric
exports, no future app files. Migration COPIES (never moves) old session
files in on the first launch after updating, one-shot flag
`didMigrateTranscriptsSubfolder`; originals stay put because external tools
may already point at them, and a copy can't lose data. The copy keeps its
filename and a name already present in `transcripts/` is skipped, so the
migration is idempotent on its own — the flag can't be the only guard, since
a second Mac on the same iCloud-synced Documents (or a Documents-only
restore) starts with the flag unset and both folders already populated, and
suffixed re-copies would double every meeting in the list and the index. A
custom Settings-chosen folder is never migrated — it's the user's own choice.

New files are named `2026-08-31T14-30_partner-sync_chad-anna.md` (ISO
date-time, slugified title, slugified participant first names) so a plain
listing sorts chronologically and globs find meetings by name. Old
`session_*.md` files are NEVER renamed — every parser
(TranscriptSearch.sessionDate) reads both shapes forever, and sorting is by
parsed date, not filename string, since the two shapes interleave. Collisions
get a numeric suffix now (Granola's old bump-a-minute trick existed only
because a suffix used to hide the file from the `session_` prefix filter;
the new filter keys on the date stamp, so suffixes are safe).

Each save also writes a `.json` sidecar and appends one line to
`index.jsonl` (append-only by contract — deletes leave stale lines rather
than rewriting history; readers resolve against files that exist).
TranscriptStore.swift owns naming + sidecars + migration and is
Foundation-only so test rigs compile it standalone.

## 2026-09-01 — One voice, one enrollment: same-person profile dedupe

Field report (1:1 with Anna): her turns flipped between "anna" and
"Anna Notario" all call, with short replies falling back to raw "Them".
The store held BOTH profiles (saved in different sessions), and both
enrolled. FluidAudio's `enrollSpeaker` deliberately prefers assigning an
unnamed slot, so two clips of the same voice always pin two slots to that
person — LS-EEND then oscillates between them, and the phantom second
"distinct" remote speaker disables the one-on-one alias (evidence ≥ 2
labels), leaking bare "Them" on undiarized fragments.

Fix is non-destructive and name-based: `VoiceProfileStore.samePerson`
(equal names, or a bare first name matching the other's first word —
"anna" ~ "Anna Notario", but "Anna Smith" ≠ "Anna Notario") collapses
duplicates at enrollment only (`loadForEnrollment`; first in
hint-then-recency order wins). Files are never merged or deleted: the
heuristic can be wrong (two people genuinely named just "anna"), and a
wrong silent delete would violate the 2026-07-28 "never auto-apply names"
principle. Worst case of a wrong collapse: the second Anna shows as
"Them N" and can be renamed — strictly better than the split-identity
failure. SpeakerNameInference applies the same matcher to taken names so
a confirmed LLM suggestion can't mint the duplicate in the first place
(that's the likely origin: "anna" enrolled + unnamed ghost slot → model
suggests "Anna Notario" from intro evidence → confirm saved profile #2).
Embedding-distance dedupe was considered and rejected: LS-EEND exposes no
enrollment embeddings (attractors are internal).

## 2026-09-02 — Scoped enrollment + one-tap merge card (speaker labeling)

Follow-up to the 2026-09-01 dedupe, approved by Noah ("just do 1 + 2").

**Scoped enrollment.** Every saved profile used to enroll into every call
(8 people on a 1:1, including the user's own voice on the far-side
channel) — each one a live attractor for misattribution. Now: named
pre-call participants enroll ONLY same-person-matching profiles — an
unmatched real guest shows as "Them N" and is renameable, strictly better
than an absent person's name claiming their words. No participants named
→ cap at the 4 most recently used (`recentEnrollmentCap`; recency is the
only signal available, and `touch()` keeps it honest). Participant names
ride a new `AudioCaptureManager.expectedParticipants`, NOT
`contextualHints` — hints mix in vocabulary canonicals, which must never
scope people.

**Merge card.** When exactly two remote labels own transcript words and
they're probably one person — same-person names anywhere, or ANY pair in
a call the pre-call form said was 1:1 — the existing suggestion bar shows
"X and Y sound like the same person" (`SpeakerNameSuggestion.kind ==
.samePerson`). Confirm routes through `renameSpeaker`, so transcript,
live timeline, voice profile, and the returning 1:1 alias all follow;
dismiss lands in the rejected set like any suggestion. Never
auto-applied (2026-07-28 principle). Two guards keep it honest: the
surviving label must be a real name (merging INTO "Them 2" would save a
profile named "Them 2"), and the pair is vetoed when the labels' diarized
speech overlaps >0.5s in total — one voice cannot talk over itself, so
overlap means a real second guest the form didn't mention. Two full
names neither matching the expected guest stay untouched: no evidence
which is right.

## 2026-09-02 — Review fixes: enrollment scoping needs consent; merge card needs the named guest

Two review findings on the change above, both about the pre-call form
being trusted more than it earns.

**Enrollment scopes only on a confirmed guest list.** `preCallContext`
deliberately outlives a session — `endSession` clears `plannedQuestions`
and explicitly leaves goal/participants as the "last-used context", and
the "Go live" button plus the menu-bar/detection starts all reuse it
without reopening the form. Scoping enrollment to that list therefore
meant: fill the form in once, and every later formless call silently
enrolls the *previous* meeting's guests, so the people actually on the
call lose their saved voices and come back as "Them 1" — the exact
failure this branch set out to fix. `startLive` now takes
`participantsConfirmed`, passed true only from `PreCallFormView`'s start
closure; otherwise `expectedParticipants` is empty and the recency cap
applies. Clearing `participants` in `endSession` was the other option
and was rejected — it would throw away the last-used context the form
deliberately keeps for the goal/participants fields.

**A mixed slot/name pair merges only into the expected guest.** In the
one-slot-one-name case, `samePerson` can never be true (a slot label
never reads as the same person as a name), so the ONLY thing letting
that pair through is "the form said 1:1". The surviving name was not
checked against the form, so a 1:1 that turned out to have two guests —
form says Anna, colleague Chad gets named from transcript evidence,
Anna is still "Them 2" — offered "Them 2 and Chad sound like the same
person", and confirming would have saved Anna's voice clip under Chad's
profile. Now the surviving name must `samePerson`-match
`preCallRemoteName`, matching the guard the two-full-names branch
already had.

## 2026-09-04 — Granola-class reviews + ask-your-meetings search

Noah benchmarked our output against Granola (attachments in the shanghai
workspace). Three decisions:

**Review body is topic sections, not a flat takeaway list.** The header
contract stays five labels (parser survival on small models), but
KEY TAKEAWAYS became `NOTES:` containing `### topic` lines with dense
factual bullets. Parse rule that matters: a `#`-prefixed line becomes a
topic heading UNLESS its cleaned text is a canonical section name —
checked BEFORE the fuzzy sectionFor, because "Role and focus" is a topic,
not the NEXT MEETING FOCUS header (found by a real test failure). Legacy
persisted reviews (flat **Key Takeaways**) still parse; `takeaways` stays
as the deterministic/legacy bucket. Review call budget is 10240 ctx /
1200 predict — 1024 truncated a real 52-min transcript's last section.

**Hallucination guards earned by real runs, not theory.** Tested the
prompt against the real Noah/Nick transcript on qwen3.5:9b and :4b:
models invented a name ("Chad", who was merely *mentioned*) and
deadlines ("by Friday" — copied from the example's own next step). Fixes
that worked: an explicit mentioned≠speaker rule, owners restricted to
transcript names/You/Them/(owner unclear), and stripping the deadline
from the in-prompt example. Residual: models still occasionally glue on
soft deadlines; accepted for now.

**Search = all-words matching + an opt-in local Ask card, not embeddings.**
Multi-word queries now require every token on a line (any order) —
Foundation-only so the MCP server rig keeps compiling TranscriptSearch
standalone. "Ask AI" lives in SearchResultsView and is deliberately
retrieval-then-LLM with no index: score sessions by distinct question
words (coverage beats volume), take the 14 best-matching lines per
session (best, not first — "team" filled the cap before multi-word lines)
plus the saved ## Review, cap 4 sessions/12k chars, answer grounded
"ONLY the excerpts" with meeting citations. Degraded modes are visible
(no model / no matching meetings say why), per the standing rule.

## 2026-09-15 — MeetMouse is layered onto current main, not restored as an August snapshot

The MeetMouse redesign branch diverged before 24 later product commits. It is
merged with its original history intact, while conflict resolution keeps the
current transcript store, date-led filenames, session review/search behavior,
and benchmark history. The redesign supplies the public MeetMouse name, coral
mouse visual system, site/package copy, and compatibility choices. Why: taking
the old branch wholesale would silently discard shipped 0.19–0.22 behavior;
reapplying only visual/name changes preserves both the redesign and current app.

## 2026-09-15 — Rebrand context is for existing users; green comes from NoahKagan.com

The “Meeting Coach is now MeetMouse” announcement is a once-per-install sheet
shown only when `hasSeenDemo` proves the person used the app before the rename.
Fresh installs mark the announcement handled and go straight to the ordinary
MeetMouse welcome; explaining an old name they never saw would add confusion.
The acknowledgment is explicit (“Got it”) and cannot be dismissed accidentally,
so quitting before reading makes it return on the next launch. The sheet promises
only compatibility guarantees the rebrand actually preserves: transcripts,
settings, models, history, and local privacy.

All success/live/positive green now resolves through one token at `#2BBD3E`,
the current `--bs-primary` value in NoahKagan.com’s production stylesheet.
System green and the old `#00C838` token were close but visibly inconsistent;
coral remains MeetMouse’s primary action color.

## 2026-09-15 — Noah green replaces coral, and the phone-listening mouse is the mark

Reverses the last clause above after Noah reviewed the announcement live: the
NoahKagan.com green is the whole MeetMouse brand color, not just a semantic
success color. Primary, hover, pressed, tint, meeting-detection, live, and
positive states now share the site’s production green scale (`#2BBD3E` base,
`#4BC75B` hover, `#55CA65` active). This keeps the app visually inside the Noah
Kagan family instead of running a competing coral identity.

The selected icon is the existing phone-listening concept, recolored onto the
green tile. Why: a generic mouse says only “mouse”; a mouse holding a phone to
its ear instantly adds the meeting/listening story and matches the original
MeetMouse direction Noah remembered. The side-profile, phone-call, and headset
sources remain tracked as alternates.

## 2026-09-15 — In-app branding uses a named asset, not the application icon API

The header, welcome, and rebrand views load `MeetMouseBrandIcon` directly from
the asset catalog. `NSApp.applicationIconImage` is reserved for OS-owned app
identity because Launch Services may cache an older bundle icon after a local
rebuild, which made the already-green MeetMouse build appear coral inside the
app. A named asset makes in-app branding deterministic while leaving macOS to
manage the Dock and Finder icon caches.

## 2026-09-15 — The MeetMouse tile has true transparent corners

The generated green source declared an alpha channel but every pixel was still
opaque, with black RGB pixels surrounding the rounded tile. The production
master now makes only the dark matte connected to the image boundary
transparent; the mouse, phone, shadows, and green tile remain unchanged. All
app, in-app, and site sizes are regenerated from that corrected master so the
mark sits cleanly on both light and dark UI surfaces.

## 2026-09-16 — AppSumo media leads with the product, not decorative mockups

The AppSumo set uses one dominant, readable MeetMouse product surface per 16:9
frame, with a bold green brand field and short benefit-led copy. This combines
the clearest patterns from the current top two homepage deals: immediate brand
recognition in the hero and focused feature proof in the gallery. The exact
one-word `MeetMouse` name is used throughout. Product captures come only from
the bundled synthetic demo or aggregate dashboard metrics, so no personal
meeting data ships in marketing assets. Generative imagery is limited to the
subtle green audio-wave background; the logo, product UI, and claims remain
deterministic and directly inspectable.

## 2026-09-16 — MeetMouse reuses the established Cloudflare Pages project

The public site now serves from `meetmouse.com`, but the Cloudflare Pages project
keeps its internal `meetcoach` name. Renaming by replacement would throw away
deployment history, preview URLs, and working legacy-domain attachments without
changing anything customers see. Both apex and `www` are attached as Pages
custom domains through proxied CNAMEs; `www` receives a permanent redirect to
the apex with path and query preservation so canonical URLs remain singular.
The old `getmeetingcoach.com` domains remain attached for continuity.

The root `wrangler.toml`, downloaded from the live project and completed with
`pages_build_output_dir = "./docs"`, is now the deployment source of truth.
This keeps manual and release deploys on the same checked-in configuration while
leaving credentials out of the repository.

## 2026-09-16 — The GitHub repository is named MeetMouse; Conductor paths stay managed

The GitHub repository is renamed from `noahdevkagan/coach` to
`noahdevkagan/meetmouse`, with its description and homepage updated to the
current product. GitHub's automatic redirect keeps old clone links working,
while the canonical remote and README now use the new name. The local
`.../workspaces/coach/prague` path is intentionally unchanged because Conductor
owns workspace directory structure; renaming it underneath the app could break
workspace bookkeeping without improving public branding.

## 2026-09-16 — MeetMouse owns the public support and download identity

Customer-facing support now uses `support@meetmouse.com`, forwarded through
Cloudflare Email Routing to Noah's already-verified Gmail destination. Public
site footers, AppSumo redemption help, the download thank-you page, and the
in-app feedback form all expose the branded address rather than a personal one.

Every historical GitHub release asset was renamed from `MeetingCoach-*.dmg` to
`MeetMouse-*.dmg`, and the live Sparkle appcast was changed in the same operation
so existing installs keep a valid update URL. The packaging script already
derives future DMG names from the `MeetMouse` app name. Legacy apex and `www`
requests receive one Cloudflare 301 rule to `https://meetmouse.com` that carries
the original path and query string, avoiding split canonical URLs.

## 2026-09-16 — The changelog generator never publishes the Unreleased section

`CHANGELOG.md` keeps an `## Unreleased` staging section for notes written before
a version number exists, but `build-changelog.py` previously only skipped
*empty* sections, so the first bullet landed on meetmouse.com/changelog as a
release literally titled "Unreleased", above 0.22.0. The generator now drops
that section by name: notes reach the site only once they ship, under their real
version. The section still has to be renamed to `## X.Y.Z` before tagging —
`package-release.sh` matches the version heading to build the Sparkle update
dialog, and falls back to commit subjects when it finds none.

## 2026-09-16 — The menu-bar mouse is placed against its ink, not its line box

`NSAttributedString.size()` reports Apple Color Emoji's line box (20x25 at
15.5pt), which is several points taller than the glyph itself, so
centring on it pushed the mouse's feet and tail below the 18pt canvas. At 15.5pt
the ink alone is 19.4pt and cannot fit that canvas at any offset. The mark is now
drawn at 14pt from `y: 0`, which seats the whole animal with the status dot clear
of it.

## 2026-09-16 — Rebranded installs rename themselves after exit

Sparkle updates the contents of the existing bundle URL and, with its standard
Swift Package Manager build, does not normalize a renamed app on disk. That left
upgraded users with a correctly branded MeetMouse binary inside a Finder item
named `MeetingCoach.app`. Release builds now detect only that exact legacy path,
spawn a helper that waits for the running process to exit, rename it to
`MeetMouse.app`, and relaunch it. The bundle identifier and compatibility data
paths remain unchanged; Debug builds never touch an installed bundle. The
Sparkle `SUBundleName` is also explicit so update archives continue to resolve
the new bundle name.


## 2026-09-17 — Guest names need this call's evidence; one voice does not prove one-on-one

Field report: a Meet call shows Tadeáš highlighted while MeetMouse labels the
live partial “anna.” Two code paths permit this: the pre-call remote alias
ignored `participantsConfirmed`, and unknown calls enrolled four recent saved
voices. Enrollment itself refreshed their recency, even if they never attended.

Supersedes the September 2 recent-contact fallback: no confirmed guest list
means no named enrollment. Saved profiles remain intact and in-call naming
still works. Enrollment no longer touches lastUsedAt; explicit profile saves
still do. Keep last-used form values for editing, but exclude unconfirmed
participants from aliases, merge hints, ASR hints, coaching/review prompts,
saved titles, filenames, and sidecar participants.

Only a confirmed one-on-one may name unassigned remote speech. A first named
voice in an unknown or declared group call is not evidence that everyone else
is absent. Either audio or transcript evidence of a second speaker suspends
that alias. This deliberately supersedes the August phantom-slot exception:
brief neutral labels are preferable to confidently assigning a new guest's
words to the first person. Remote base-label renames no longer permanently
relabel later raw utterances; confirmed one-on-one aliases stay reversible.
Named, diarized turns and manual corrections continue to carry their names.

Saved profile samples now subtract other slots' finalized and tentative speech intervals,
because the source audio still contains both voices during overlap. This
protects against detected overlap, not diarization errors the model misses;
only explicit naming can create/refresh a profile, as before.

No screen-reading or browser integration is included in this fix. Meet tile
names plus timestamped active-speaker cues remain a separate integration to
prototype and validate on real calls; the app does not infer a stranger's
name from audio alone.

## 2026-09-17 — Release uploads are bare-create-then-retry, never delete-first

The v0.24.0 release died three runs in a row on uploads.github.com 500s
("Error uploading", "Error creating asset temp dir", "Error saving asset"),
and both upload paths made a transient failure destructive: the softprops
action deletes the existing DMG before uploading its replacement (retry 2's
good asset was destroyed by retry 3's failed upload), and `gh release create`
with assets attached rolls the entire release back when an asset upload
fails, which left the fallback `gh release upload` with "release not found".
release.yml now creates each release bare, then uploads the DMG (and the
appcast PUT) under a 5-attempt backoff retry — a flaky upload can retry
freely and can never remove anything already live. workflow_dispatch is the
recovery path for an already-pushed tag: it runs the workflow from main, so
fixes apply without deleting/re-pushing the tag.


## 2026-09-17 — Meeting chat is the primary experience; coaching is secondary

Noah explicitly prefers chat over coaching as the main product. Saved meetings
now open into Chat (search matches still open Transcript), and a meetings home
replaces the progress dashboard. Progress remains in secondary navigation; the
existing coaching and local-only inference behavior stays available. The shared
card style and green palette remain, with simpler typography and a pinned composer.

Reused the existing on-device Q&A rather than adding another provider. Retrieval
carries recent question subjects into follow-ups, includes neighboring turns, and
samples through the final turn for broad questions. Prompts require evidence and
separate proposed follow-ups from explicit commitments. Chat is in-memory for the
open meeting, as before; it does not modify the saved transcript. Request tasks
cancel with view identity changes and check cancellation after each suspension so
late answers cannot appear under a different meeting.

Conductor's installed UI exposes no repository rename command (actions and Git /
Misc settings checked); its CLI renames workspaces/sessions only. No managed paths
or internal database records were altered to force a cosmetic rename.


## 2026-09-17 — The live transcript owns the window

Following Noah's request to extend the chat-first redesign into meetings, the
always-visible coach rail becomes an on-demand popover. Live text gets a centered
reading column with names/times above paragraphs rather than a three-column log.
Talk-share moves beside coaching; capture warnings remain in the main pane. An
explicit auto-scroll toggle lets users read earlier turns without new words pulling
them away. Sidebar visibility is independent of recording, with Stop always in the
meeting header. Presentation only: coalescing, speaker identity, word correction,
and capture/coaching engines retain their existing behavior.


## 2026-09-20 — Coaching stays open during meetings

Supersedes the on-demand popover decision: Noah checks coaching routinely during
calls and wants it visible by default. Restore a resizable pane beside the live
transcript, with talk-share and coaching history. The header toggle can hide it
for the current meeting; starting another meeting opens it again. Keep the compact
header above both panes so its controls do not crowd the transcript. Chat remains
the primary post-meeting experience.


## 2026-09-20 — Sidebar navigation uses rows rather than stacked cards

Noah's dark-mode screenshot showed an oversized Start pill, nested boxed sections,
low-contrast captions, cramped dates, and a saved-file management block competing
with meeting navigation. Removed the outer sidebar cards, used a compact native
primary button, enlarged the search field, and stacked dates below meeting titles.
Selected meetings get a subtle green fill. Saved status is one quiet row; the
existing dismiss/reveal/delete actions live in its overflow menu. Keep never saved
anything (the transcript was already saved); Dismiss now names that action honestly.


## 2026-09-20 — Meeting chats persist separately; citations require an exact source

Completed Q&A turns now live in an atomically written <meeting-stem>.chat.json
sidecar beside the transcript. This survives title edits, regenerated notes, and
reopening without mixing AI answers into source material or search results. Clear
chat removes only that sidecar (with confirmation), and deleting a session removes
its chat too. Failed reads report an error instead of silently replacing unreadable
history; failed writes keep the answer visible and offer retry. Drafts/in-flight
requests are not persisted.

Bracketed timestamps become links only when their normalized time matches an actual
transcript row. Clicking opens Transcript, scrolls to that row, and highlights it;
unmatched model citations remain plain text. Never guess a nearby source.

Live following pauses on native NSScrollView user-scroll notifications when the
reader leaves the bottom. Content growth and programmatic scrollTo are not treated
as user intent. Back to live explicitly restores following; the manual toggle
remains available. Uses AppKit for macOS 14 compatibility.


## 2026-09-20 — Restore the existing opt-in sharing loop in the redesigned app

Noah remembered the viral sharing work in the milan workspace and asked to enable
it here. Ported its encryption, share preview/success sheet, saved owner controls,
Worker/D1 source, and regression tests without replacing redesigned session views.
This is the explicitly requested exception to offline-only networking: no background
upload or meeting sync; users preview and publish one curated notes snapshot.
Transcript, coaching, audio, and persisted chat are excluded from the wire payload.

Keep the established Cloudflare service/database and rhinovoice.app routes for
compatibility. Both dev and release default to these HTTPS endpoints, so rebuilding
does not silently point sharing to a missing localhost server. Recipient source is
rebranded to MeetMouse with a meetmouse.com discovery CTA; deployment is still needed
for that source change, since this sandbox has no outbound DNS. Existing live page
branding may remain Rhino until deployed. No real meeting was uploaded in this task.


## 2026-09-20 — Grow through useful, voluntarily forwarded notes

The user asked for maximum respectful virality. Make Send prominent once a user
creates a link, let recipients copy a complete useful recap or forward the complete
private link, and place one MeetMouse invitation after the notes. Copied recaps
include a small attribution that the user can edit in the destination. Preserve
fragment keys during forwarding; cancelled native shares do not silently copy.
No forced signup, contact import, automatic sending, tracking, or referral gates.
Encrypted snapshots, expiry, revocation, and preview remain unchanged. This makes
recipient value the reason to share, without pressuring senders or recipients.


## 2026-09-20 — Durable sharing ownership and consistent recipient appearance

Sharing capabilities are persisted before network I/O and retained on ambiguous
failures. A stable flock lock file protects reload/mutate/atomic-write transactions
across installed and dev processes. Records are keyed by share ID, so creating a
second snapshot never discards the first snapshot's revocation token. Pending
records do not expire locally until explicitly resolved. A Shared links manager
on Meetings retains revocation access after local transcript deletion without
forcing local deletion to require networking.

The Worker keeps empty-ciphertext revocation tombstones until expiry, including for
unknown IDs: a cancelled in-flight upload cannot arrive late and resurrect a link.
No new schema or service is needed. Open meeting notes observe the latest session's
review completion and show its generation state rather than encouraging duplicate
work. The web viewer now follows system appearance using Dorado light/dark tokens,
app-sized headings, neutral surfaces, and restrained green accents; no remote fonts.


## 2026-09-21 — Isolate dependency Git from the push hook environment

The app build passed in the user's Terminal but the SwiftPM ASR rig could not read
its pinned FluidAudio tree. That tree exists; inheriting the app's GIT_DIR reproduces
failed dependency lookup. Clear Git's declared repository-local environment in the
push gate after entering the workspace, so nested dependency commands discover their
own repositories. Also retain full Xcode diagnostics and its exit code instead of
piping the build into grep -q. This preserves the gate rather than skipping tests.

## 2026-09-21 — Bound cancellation storage and retain long-turn evidence

Missing-ID revocations consume the same client-IP quota as share creation because
both allocate database rows. Existing records remain revocable even when that
quota is exhausted; owner-token checks still apply. Tombstones continue to block
late uploads after cancellation.

Long chat excerpts retain their original timestamp/speaker and choose a bounded
window with the most distinct query matches. This preserves late decisions in
coalesced turns while keeping the existing 700-character and total-context caps.

## 2026-09-21 — Ended demo yields the main pane to explicit navigation

A finished demo leaves `hasSession` true with no `savedPath`, which pinned the
main pane to the live view and made the sidebar's Meetings / Coaching progress
buttons silent no-ops. Rejected excluding demos from that branch outright: the
"Demo meeting · Ended" header exists to keep the replayed result visible.
Instead a `leftLiveView` flag records deliberate navigation away and is cleared
when the next session starts, so the demo result persists until the user leaves
it on purpose.

## 2026-09-21 — Explicit BYOK is an optional exception to local inference

The user requested Claude and OpenAI API keys in Settings. Local AI remains the
default; transcription/audio and telemetry policy are unchanged. Settings → AI
requires a text-sharing acknowledgment plus Save and enable. Keys live only in
device-only Keychain; testing uses a synthetic prompt and does not enable cloud.
Direct HTTPS provider requests need no MeetMouse account/backend. OpenAI requests
set store:false, sessions are ephemeral, redirects are refused, and provider
error bodies are never displayed/logged. Provider retention rules still apply.

AIClient wraps existing Ollama completions and the two cloud APIs. The existing
string-based lifecycle pins namespaced cloud model references, preserving its
review/test seams and ensuring local sessions never switch to cloud mid-call.
Cloud references bypass local memory/preload/unload and require the matching
active preference before every request; disabling/switching stops future sends.
In-flight requests cannot be recalled. Built-in signals and transcription survive
cloud failure. Initial model choices favor small, fast models for recurring
coaching, with one larger option per provider. No subscription-login support.

## 2026-09-21 — Share notes prepares missing notes in one click

Share notes now generates missing AI notes with the configured provider and opens
its preview on completion. It waits for an active review instead of duplicating it;
failed background reviews can fall through to explicit generation. Generation lives
on the meeting view rather than the Notes tab so switching tabs cannot restart it.
Unavailable AI/empty results show errors and allow retry. Existing curated notes
open immediately; encryption and explicit Create private link remain unchanged.


## 2026-09-21 — Share notes directly prepares the private link

The user explicitly requested skipping Create private link and going directly
to the ready/copied screen. Share notes now authorizes creation of the curated,
encrypted 30-day snapshot; no second preview confirmation is required. Show a
brief progress state and explicit retry on failure, retaining durable pending
ownership and all existing payload exclusions. Existing shared-link controls
remain available. This supersedes the prior mandatory preview checkpoint.

## 2026-09-21 — Merge automatic note generation with direct sharing

Preserve main's explicitly authorized direct-link flow while retaining this branch's
missing-note generation, duplicate-request guard, and retryable errors. Once notes
are ready, the existing sharing sheet creates/copies the encrypted snapshot; there
is no restored preview checkpoint. Update help text and changelog to match.

## 2026-09-23 — Notes is the default for saved meetings

The user wants meeting notes immediately after a call rather than the meetings
home or empty chat. Saved meeting details now default to Notes; transcript search
continues to open Transcript, and Chat remains available as a tab. Observe the
post-session flag on initial window presentation too, so calls ended with the
window closed still open their saved detail. Skip that initial replay while a
call is live: the flag and saved path outlive the next Start, so they would
cover the live transcript with the previous meeting. This supersedes the September 17
Chat-default choice without changing capture, saving, or review generation.

## 2026-09-23 — Claude subscription through the official local CLI

User explicitly requested enabling their Claude account for in-app coaching and
reviews. Add a separate Claude account provider to shared AIClient, retaining
local defaults and the existing consent/pinned-provider checks. Anthropic's
current support notice says CLI/SDK subscription usage continues while its planned
billing changes are paused:
https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan

Use the installed official CLI (minimum 2.1.280, which supports safe mode), never
extract tokens or build a private OAuth client. Subscription auth is verified on
each completion; inherited API/provider/proxy/debug settings are excluded. Safe
mode, no tools, strict empty MCP, no skills/browser integration or file-mention expansion, no session
persistence and disabled nonessential traffic prevent coding-agent behavior.
Prompts travel on stdin, not argv/files. Bound output, terminate only the owned
process on timeout/cancellation, and redact raw CLI failures. Haiku is the default
for latency; Sonnet is optional. CLI/plan limits remain provider-controlled.
The UI's sample test is the only explicit path that bypasses meeting-text consent.

The installed release is actively recording during implementation. Do not replace,
restart, or change its running session mid-call. Official browser login and live
synthetic Haiku/Sonnet checks subsequently succeeded. At the user's explicit
request, save Claude account / Haiku for the next launch of the updated build;
the old running release/session remains local. No real meeting content was sent.

### Claude account: hard output cap far above the soft target; reject multi-turn results (2026-09-23)
Root cause of the truncated long-meeting notes: when a reply exceeds
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS, CLI 2.1.280 silently continues in new turns and
`--output-format json` reports success (`stop_reason: end_turn`, `num_turns: 3`)
with `result` holding only the last turn — e.g. only NEXT MEETING FOCUS. Verified
with a synthetic five-section prompt: cap 256 → only section five; cap 8192 → all
five, `num_turns: 1`. The cap is now max(8192, 4× budget) as a runaway guard only
(length is steered by the prompt's soft target), and `parse` requires
`num_turns == 1` so any recovery fails loudly instead of saving partial notes.


## 2026-09-24 — Compact ambient overlay with cumulative share edges

The user selected a 144 × 44 bubble with no speaker labels. Use 7-point green
(You) and blue (Them) edges, filled top-down by session share; only the waveform
changes color with the active speaker. Reuse TalkStats' existing word-based
estimate, not elapsed meeting time or a new capture-derived metric. Silence does
not add share, and absent/unknown attribution stays unfilled instead of inventing
50/50. The tooltip and accessibility value call this an estimated talk share.
Recognition events drive the decorative waveform, with a 2.5-second expiry;
it is not a raw audio-level/VAD meter and can lag speech recognition.

Nudges and actionable memory/basic-mode notices retain their expanded presentation.
A borderless NSPanel fits its content while anchoring the top-right corner and
preserving saved drag positions. The ambient bubble has a Hide overlay context
menu and accessibility action, keeping a persistent close icon out of the design.

The push gate exposed an existing backtest build-list omission: AIClient now
references ClaudeAccount but bench/backtest.sh did not compile that file. Add
its source to the harness so nudge golden replays can run; no signal behavior
or golden expectations change.
