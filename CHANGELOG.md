# Changelog

High-level, user-facing notes per release. **These bullets appear inside the
app's update dialog** (and on the GitHub Release). Before tagging `vX.Y.Z`, add
a `## X.Y.Z` section here; if a version has no section, release notes fall back
to commit subjects since the previous tag.

Keep bullets short and user-facing — what changed for *them*, not how.

## Unreleased

- Watching the demo no longer blocks the Meetings and Coaching progress buttons; the demo result stays visible until you navigate away
- Meeting chat keeps relevant details from later in long speaker turns; sharing abuse limits also cover cancelled uploads without blocking existing owners from stopping sharing

- Shared links keep recovery controls through failed uploads, multiple app instances, and local meeting deletion; manage them from Meetings → Shared links
- Post-meeting notes refresh when AI generation completes, and shared pages match MeetMouse with automatic light/dark appearance

- Shared notes open without an account, with easy forwarding and copyable next steps; recipients can discover MeetMouse after reading

- Share saved meeting notes with an encrypted, expiring web link. Preview the notes, send or copy the link, and stop sharing from the meeting; transcripts and AI chats are excluded

- Meeting chats now save locally and restore when you return. Click a valid answer timestamp to jump to its transcript source
- Scrolling back through a live transcript pauses auto-scroll; use Back to live to resume following

- Simplified the sidebar with a compact Start button, roomier meeting rows, clearer selection, and a quieter saved confirmation

- Live transcripts have larger text, clearer speaker headings, a pauseable auto-scroll control, and a coaching pane that opens by default during meetings and can be hidden. Hide the slimmer sidebar to focus on the conversation

- Meetings now open into a dedicated AI chat, with suggested questions, follow-ups, copyable answers, and a stop button. Notes, transcripts, and coaching remain one click away
- A cleaner meetings home replaces the coaching dashboard as the starting view; coaching progress stays available in the sidebar
- Meeting questions keep the topic of recent follow-ups and more surrounding transcript context, with timestamp citations requested from the local model

- Speaker names no longer carry over from an unconfirmed previous meeting. Saved voices are used only for guests confirmed in this call's setup; other speakers stay neutral until identified
- Group calls keep each named speaker separate, and unassigned live text no longer inherits the first person's name. Saved voice samples exclude detected overlapping speech

## 0.24.0 — 2026-09-17

- Speaker names now come only from the people you confirm in this call's setup. MeetMouse no longer reaches back to whoever you met with last time — that guest's name can't appear on live text, ASR hints, coaching prompts, saved titles, filenames, or transcript metadata for a call they weren't part of
- Naming one person no longer names everyone. Previously a single named voice was taken as proof of a one-on-one, so unassigned speech inherited that name; now a second detected voice suspends the guess and each speaker keeps their own label
- Saved voice profiles are cleaner: a speaker's voice clip now excludes other people's overlapping speech, so a crosstalk moment can't be learned as someone's voice. If less than three seconds of solo speech is available, no profile is saved rather than a bad one

## 0.23.1 — 2026-09-17

- MeetMouse now actually shows up as "MeetMouse" in Finder, the Dock, and Spotlight. If you updated from Meeting Coach, the app on disk kept its old `MeetingCoach.app` filename — it renames itself once on the next launch and reopens straight away. Settings, models, transcripts, permissions, and updates all carry over untouched

## 0.23.0 — 2026-09-16

- The app has a new name and face: MeetMouse, with a phone-listening gray mouse on NoahKagan green throughout the app and the same recognizable animal in the menu bar. Your settings, models, transcripts, and updates continue exactly where they left off
- If you had connected an AI agent, re-add it: the built-in MCP server moved with the rename. Open Advanced → Agent access and copy the new `claude mcp add` command — an older `meetingcoach` entry points at a path that no longer exists

## 0.22.0 — 2026-09-04

- Meeting reviews are now organized by topic: a NOTES section with a heading per subject discussed and dense factual bullets under each, plus NEXT STEPS with an owner on every item — instead of one flat list of takeaways. Long meetings fit whole: a 43-minute call is reviewed untrimmed
- Reviews stick closer to what was actually said: someone who was mentioned is no longer written up as if they spoke, and no deadlines are invented that nobody committed to. Reviews saved by earlier versions still open as before
- Search matches every word you type, in any order, and highlights each match — "pricing anna" finds the meeting where Anna raised pricing, however the words fell
- New "Ask AI" card in search results: ask a question across your saved meetings ("what did we decide about the launch date?") and get an answer that cites which meeting each point came from. Runs on your local model; if none is installed, or no meeting matches, it says so
- Open any saved meeting and ask it questions in the new ask bar at the bottom — answers come from that meeting's transcript and review only
- The AI model picker now shows each model's download size next to its name

## 0.21.0 — 2026-09-02

- New "AI coaching" toggle in Settings → Model: turn it off and MeetingCoach runs transcript-first — live transcript, speaker names, and built-in nudges keep working, but no AI model is loaded. Flip it off mid-call and the memory (~7 GB for the default model) comes back right away, not next session. "Generate AI review" on saved sessions still works on demand
- If the AI model is slowing your Mac, a 🐢 tip now appears in the main window and floating overlay with a one-click way to turn AI coaching off; the low-memory banner offers the same. Decline it three times and it stays quiet
- Transcripts now live in `~/Documents/MeetingCoach/transcripts/`, named by date and title (e.g. `2026-08-31T14-30_partner-sync_chad-anna.md`) so a file listing reads as a timeline, with a small `.json` file beside each one and a running `index.jsonl` — point Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI tool at that one folder and it gets transcripts and nothing else. Your existing sessions are copied in (never moved or renamed) the first time you launch
- Fixed one person showing up as two speakers in a one-on-one when you had saved them under two names (like "anna" and "Anna Notario"): their turns no longer flip between names, and short replies stay attributed. If two labels still look like the same person, a one-tap "sound like the same person" card merges them — transcript, timeline, and saved voice profile included
- Voice recognition now only looks for the people who are actually on the call (the guests you listed in pre-call setup, or your 4 most recent contacts) instead of everyone you've ever named
- The Coach suggestions card now says what clicking does — "Space it out" shows the real wait it proposes ("about 90s between repeats instead of 60s"), "Turn it off" / "Keep it" replace the vague Apply/Dismiss — and it no longer proposes spacing out a nudge that is already at its limit
- Fixed a fresh install occasionally running without AI coaching: if the first transcription-model download failed and you clicked Retry, the AI model download that was supposed to follow never started until the next launch

## 0.20.1 — 2026-08-18

- Picking a different AI model during a live session now says what actually happens: the session keeps the model it started with, and your new pick takes over from your next session — before, the change looked ignored
- The low-memory banner now tells you when a small model is installed and ready for your next session, instead of going quiet right after its download finishes

## 0.20.0 — 2026-08-14

- When the full AI coach cannot load because your Mac is busy or low on memory, the main window and floating overlay now say “Basic mode” instead of leaving you wondering why no AI nudges appear; built-in coaching keeps working
- MeetingCoach now tries smaller AI models you already downloaded before falling back to basic mode
- If you do not have a lightweight fallback yet, the low-memory banner offers a one-click ~2.1 GB download for future meetings without changing your preferred model
- Fixed named speakers occasionally losing their name on short replies in a one-on-one call when speaker detection briefly imagined an extra voice that never said anything

## 0.19.1 — 2026-08-13

- Fixed a crash that could quit MeetingCoach as a meeting started, when a headset or other microphone was still connecting. The app now gives the mic a moment to settle, and if it never becomes usable it says so instead of quitting

## 0.19.0 — 2026-08-13

- MeetingCoach now speaks your language: meetings can be transcribed in 25 languages — English plus 24 European languages, from Spanish and French to Ukrainian and Greek. Pick yours in Settings → General; by default it follows your Mac's language
- Non-English meetings use a new high-accuracy on-device engine (Apple Silicon, one ~600 MB download the first time). Your audio still never leaves your Mac
- Post-meeting notes and reviews are written in the meeting's language, and saved sessions remember their language — regenerating an old review keeps it
- In non-English meetings, live coaching sticks to what works in any language: talk time, voice share, and running over time. English meetings keep the full set
- The language you pick is locked in when a meeting starts, so changing it mid-call never scrambles a running transcript. Intel Macs stay English-only (explained right in Settings)
## 0.18.1 — 2026-08-11

- MeetMouse now checks how much memory is actually free once a call is underway — not just how much your Mac has — and picks a lighter model when your machine is busy. A 32 GB Mac with a lot already open no longer slows to a crawl mid-meeting
- If nothing can run safely, coaching continues without the AI parts instead of freezing your call, and it stays that way for the whole meeting rather than loading a model at the end
- A meeting now uses exactly one model from start to finish, and always releases it when the call is over — including when you stop before saying anything
- Models are no longer loaded speculatively when a meeting is detected: your Mac only holds one while a call is actually running

## 0.18.0 — 2026-08-11

- Naming speakers is now dependable: rename someone once and they stay named — including the words they said before the transcript learned to tell voices apart, and anything they say next. On a two-person call, naming the other person (or listing them in pre-call setup) labels the whole far side with their name; if a third voice joins, the transcript honestly goes back to numbered speakers
- Naming someone in the first moments of a call now still saves their voice — the app waits for enough speech and saves automatically, then keeps the fullest sample at the end of the call so future meetings recognize them
- Renaming a speaker after a session ends now updates the saved transcript too, so the name is still there when you reopen it
- The rename popover suggests people you've already named or met with — start typing and pick, or click a suggestion straight away
- Speaker names now show a pencil icon on hover and a one-time hint on your first real meeting, so it's obvious they're editable

- Updates now install themselves: they download quietly in the background and apply the next time the app isn't running — never during a meeting. No more missing a fix because an update popup got dismissed
- If an update has been waiting a few days (this app rarely quits, so it rarely gets the chance to install), the app offers it right after a call ends — at most once a day, and never while you're in one. The menu bar shows how long it's been waiting
- Prefer to review each update yourself? Settings → General → "Install updates automatically" turns the automatic behavior off; the menu bar dot still tells you when one is ready
- The app now records its version when it starts, so support questions get answered from your first log line instead of guesswork

## 0.17.1 — 2026-08-10

- A red dot on the menu bar icon shows when an update is waiting, with "Update available…" pinned to the top of the dropdown — so a dismissed update popup doesn't mean a missed update
- Fixed a crash on Intel Macs: the high-accuracy transcription model only runs on Apple Silicon, and starting a session on an Intel Mac could quit the app mid-meeting. Intel Macs now automatically use Apple's built-in transcription instead, and the app says clearly (during setup and in each session) that Intel isn't fully supported — reduced accuracy, no speaker identification. Intel Macs also no longer download the unusable 600 MB model
- The truth about FaceTime and phone calls on your Mac: macOS blocks every app from hearing them — including the microphone itself, which goes silent for other apps the moment a call connects. Previously the app pretended to listen anyway and blamed you for 100% of the talking; now it detects the call and tells you straight, with what actually works: answer on your iPhone on speakerphone near your Mac, or use Zoom/Meet for coached calls
- The microphone also now notices when it's receiving dead silence (a call grabbed it mid-session, a device glitch) and reconnects automatically instead of listening to nothing forever

## 0.17.0 — 2026-08-06

- FaceTime and iPhone calls taken on your Mac are now real meetings: they trigger the "Meeting detected" prompt just like Zoom, and call sessions are titled with the caller's name
- When a call's audio never reaches your Mac (you answered on the iPhone, or it's playing in a headset), the app now says "Can't hear this meeting" with how to fix it — instead of showing "Listening" over an empty transcript and then blaming a quiet room
- Sessions get real names: the AI review that reads your whole meeting now titles it — "Caitlin · margins & win-back" instead of a word collage. Your own renames always win
- The AI model frees its memory (several GB) whenever you're not in a meeting — it loads the moment a meeting is detected and unloads after your recap is ready
- Lower processor use during calls: coaching skips AI passes when the conversation hasn't moved, and transcription stops re-reading long monologues every second
- Fixed: quiet speech close to the mic could be silently discarded as speaker echo

## 0.16.0 — 2026-08-06

- Phone calls on your Mac no longer silence coaching: handing a call to the Mac makes the iPhone's microphone the system input, which delivers nothing to other apps — the app kept saying "Listening" over an empty transcript. It now detects that and listens through the Mac's own microphone instead, whether the call started before or during your session
- Granola re-import now repairs meetings that came in empty: if an earlier import left a meeting without its transcript (a bug fixed in 0.12.0), importing the same export again fills the transcript in instead of saying "already imported" — your renames and notes stay untouched
- The Questions to Ask, Coaching Notes, and Model rows in Advanced now open with a click anywhere on the row, not just the tiny chevron

## 0.15.0 — 2026-08-05

- Fixed: switching audio devices mid-meeting (taking a phone call on your Mac, connecting AirPods, plugging in a headset) silently killed the microphone — the app kept saying "Listening" but stopped transcribing. It now detects the change and reconnects to your mic automatically

## 0.14.0 — 2026-08-05

- No more picking an AI model that's too big for your Mac: the app now knows how much memory you have — the model list only shows ones that will run well, the recommended download matches your machine, and the biggest models stay reserved for Macs that can handle them
- If a too-big model does end up selected (say, from before this update), you get a clear orange note in Settings and the app quietly uses your best-fitting installed model instead — no more whole-Mac freeze mid-meeting
- The AI model now loads when the app starts, not in the first minute of your call — meetings begin with coaching ready instead of your Mac straining right when the call gets going
- Under the hood: removed a chunk of leftover code from retired features, so the app is a little leaner

## 0.13.0 — 2026-08-05

- A fresh coat of paint everywhere: new AppSumo-yellow Go live button, cleaner type, and a simpler title bar — same layout and flow you already know
- Follows your Mac's appearance: light, dark, or auto — the new design now has a proper dark side
- Meeting reviews became real meeting notes: a headline-first summary, takeaways with the actual numbers and names, and next steps as "who — what — by when". Old sessions can be rewritten too — open one and hit "Regenerate with AI" in the Summary tab
- Fixed: if the AI model you'd selected was never finished downloading, every AI feature (reviews, name suggestions, smart nudges) silently did nothing — the app now uses whichever model is actually installed
- Sessions open in tabs — Transcript, Summary, Coaching — with Copy and Export (Markdown, plain text, or just the summary)
- The sessions list shows friendly dates instead of filenames, and "See all" reveals your full history
- Your Progress is the home screen again, redesigned to match

## 0.12.0 — 2026-08-04

- Granola import actually works now — validated against a real export: your meetings come in with their true titles, notes, and full searchable transcripts (the first version choked on the file format and imported empty shells)
- Naming a speaker sticks: tagging someone while they're still labeled "Them" saved nothing before (you had to wait for "Them 1") — now every tag saves their voice locally so future meetings can label them automatically
- Much lower CPU during meetings: a bug ran two transcription engines at once every session (Apple's engine on the other side's audio even when the fast Parakeet model was loaded), and transcription re-processed audio far more often than needed — both fixed, along with meeting detection scanning your windows every 2 seconds mid-meeting
- Sessions are now named after the real meeting when possible — the Meet tab or Zoom topic ("Weekly Sync") instead of a guessed "person · topic" — and search finds chats by name, not just by what was said
- The floating overlay behaves: it stays where you drag it (forever), closing it keeps it closed for the rest of the meeting, and Settings → General has a switch to turn it off entirely — nudges still show in the main window
- The meeting-detected pill stopped repeating itself ("& open MeetMouse" line removed), and a start that fails no longer silences the pill for the rest of that meeting
- Renaming a chat back to its date now sticks instead of a topic name reappearing

## 0.11.1 — 2026-08-04

- Fixed a crash when editing lists with a row deleted mid-edit — typing in a vocabulary term, pre-call participant, or custom coaching signal and removing a row could quit the app and lose what you typed
- Vocabulary edits now confirm themselves: a green "Saved" appears when a term is stored, and a hint tells you when a row still needs its "Corrected to…" filled in to save

## 0.11.0 — 2026-08-03

- New first-run checklist: the main pane walks you to your first coached meeting — two permissions with Grant buttons, both models downloading with real progress bars (they start on their own, no clicks), then "join a meeting"
- Coming from Granola? Export your meetings as a CSV in Granola, pick the file in Settings → General, and your notes become searchable MeetMouse sessions — on your Mac, like everything else
- The give-MeetMouse-to-a-friend prompt now waits for your second coached meeting instead of interrupting the glow of the first
- Fixed: at narrow widths the coach panel could clip its cards on both edges, cutting text mid-word — the panel now refuses to shrink past readable
- The sidebar's Advanced section starts open so Questions to Ask and Coaching Notes are visible, and the whole header row is clickable

## 0.10.1 — 2026-08-03

- MeetMouse now starts automatically when you log in (so it's ready after a restart) — turn it off any time in Settings → General → Startup

## 0.10.0 — 2026-07-31

- Coaching now stops when your meeting ends, even with a TV or podcast playing nearby — background audio no longer keeps the session (and the transcript) running past the call
- The other side's words now read as full sentences: transcripts save whole thoughts with one timestamp each, instead of shredded 1-3 word lines
- Stray "Siri" / "Hey Siri" pickups from a phone or HomePod in the room no longer land in your transcript
- Product names come out right: known garbles fix themselves ("app sumo" → AppSumo, "tidy cow" → TidyCal), and a rare bug that rendered English phrases in Vietnamese characters is repaired automatically
- Click a misheard word in the transcript to fix it — the word comes pre-filled, you type what it should be, and the fix applies on the spot, to the rest of the call, and to every future meeting (right-click a line for multi-word phrases); your term list lives in Settings → General → Vocabulary

## 0.9.2 — 2026-07-29

- First sessions now say when transcript accuracy is reduced: a banner during the call (and a note on the review) explains the high-accuracy engine is still downloading and will be ready next session — no more "why did it only catch random words?"

## 0.9.1 — 2026-07-29

- Give MeetMouse to a friend for FREE: grab an invite from the menu bar (you have 3) — one click copies a ready-to-send message with a code your friend redeems free on AppSumo
- After your first coached meeting, MeetMouse asks if you know someone who'd want it too

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-28

- The transcript now tells remote speakers apart: on a group call, "Them" splits into "Them 1", "Them 2", … as each person talks
- Click any speaker's label to name them — the whole transcript relabels, and their voice is remembered on your Mac so future meetings greet them by name from the first sentence
- The coach spots names on its own ("Them 1 sounds like Sarah") and offers a one-click confirm — it never applies a name without you
- People you list in the call's goal form are recognized first
- Voice matching runs entirely on-device, like everything else — no audio or voice data ever leaves your Mac
- Tuned to stay light on long calls: less memory for audio, less work per second

## 0.8.3 — 2026-07-28

- Your Progress now counts real weeks: "this week" starts Monday, compared against all of last week — no more rolling 7-day windows that read like wrong numbers
- Coach suggestion cards now say exactly what Apply will do ("waits 50% longer between nudges", "starts watching for this next call") instead of leaving you guessing

## 0.8.2 — 2026-07-28

- Coaching Notes now actually learn from anything you paste: feedback from Claude or any AI tool gets read by your local model — known signals tune up, and brand-new patterns ("you keep selling after they've said yes") become proposed signals you approve on the Progress dashboard before the coach starts watching for them
- Installed models are recognized the moment the app opens — no more "Download Model" showing over a model you already downloaded
- Time-based nudges ("1min left", time check, overrun) now only run when you give the call a length — set it in the goal form, or pick a default for every call in Settings → General
- Questions to Ask clears itself when the call ends, ready for the next meeting's list — and still ticks off automatically as you ask them, with a tap to override either way
- "What was said" appears only on nudges that have an actual moment to quote
- The coach panel can be dragged much wider, and Progress tiles now say what they measure: your last 7 days vs the prior 7

## 0.8.1 — 2026-07-28

- Your post-meeting review is now about the conversation itself — the summary, key takeaways, and next steps come from what was actually said, decided, and promised on the call; coaching feedback lives only in "Next meeting focus"
- The Questions to Ask checklist is clickable during the call — tick a question off yourself, or untick one it marked by mistake (it stays unticked)
- "Great question" nudges now quote the question you asked and how they opened up — not a random slice from the middle of their answer

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-24

- Your post-meeting review is now a proper card — summary, key takeaways, and next steps you can check off (they stay checked). Both the instant review and the AI review use it, and old saved reviews render in the same clean layout
- Sessions name themselves: "Lindsay · radar & group" instead of a date, worked out from who you talked to and what about, with the date shown alongside. Right-click to rename
- Click a session to read it right in the app — color-coded transcript, its review up top, and one click copies the whole meeting for Slack, email, or an AI tool
- New under Advanced: Questions to Ask — paste the questions you always want covered and they show as a live checklist that ticks off as you ask them (per-meeting questions live in the goal form)
- Nudge cards can show the exact words behind a nudge ("What was said"), say what window they're judging ("last 5 min"), and take thumbs up/down feedback
- The floating overlay returns if you closed it mid-meeting and moves to the screen your call is on; praise stays up a little longer
- Joining a Google Meet in the browser now prompts in about 10 seconds (was 40) and the prompt names the platform — Meet, Hangouts, or Zoom-in-browser
- Coaching Notes now save on their own — tell the coach "watch my talk time" without pairing a transcript
- Agent access (MCP) setup moved to Settings → General

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-21

- A calmer, simpler MeetMouse: the live transcript is now the main event, with your talk-time split and elapsed time shown as quiet ambient info — not warnings
- Far fewer interruptions: only a handful of high-value nudges fire by default (talk time, one question at a time, action items, locking a real date, one genuine win). Everything else moved to Coaching Style, off by default — re-enable any signal you miss
- Zero setup to start: no goal step, no AI-nudges toggle, no focus picker. Goal setup and coaching customization live under Advanced; AI nudges and the meeting summary switch on automatically when a local model is installed
- Your recap now generates itself when you stop — summary, action items, and talk split, no button
- Search your chats: one search box over every saved conversation, grouped by meeting with the moment highlighted
- Connect Claude and other AI agents to your meetings: a built-in MCP server lets agents list, search, and read your saved transcripts — fully local, over stdio, nothing leaves your Mac. Setup: open Advanced → Agent access → copy the `claude mcp add` command (or point your agent at `MeetMouse.app/Contents/MacOS/meetmouse-mcp`)

## 0.6.3 — 2026-07-20

- Stopping a session keeps your whole transcript on screen — including the words you were still saying when you hit Stop (they now land in the saved session too)
- Nudges and Transcript panes are back to clean white; the warm tint stays in the sidebar only

## 0.6.2 — 2026-07-20

- Coaching now reliably stops when your meeting ends — saying goodbye right before hanging up no longer made it miss the ending
- No more "You're still talking" while you wait alone for others to join
- Your saved coaching notes now actually tune the coach — pasted feedback teaches the signals it names, and the save button shows what it learned
- A calmer, lighter look: warm paper background, serif titles, quieter nudge cards, and human signal names ("Stacked Qs", not "stackedQuestions")

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-20

- New recommended AI model: Qwen 3.5 — sharper coaching judgment, faster on Apple Silicon, and a smaller download
- Model catalog refreshed: Qwen 3.5 in three sizes and IBM Granite 4 added, older models retired

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-20

- New: auto-start coaching — turn it on and coaching begins by itself when a meeting is detected, after a 10-second cancelable countdown
- Meeting-end detection got smarter: coaching stops within seconds of leaving a Zoom, Meet, or huddle — and never cuts you off mid-sentence
- Nudges quiet down when you ignore them, in the moment and over time
- Copy the whole transcript with one click after a call
- Settings got tabs: pick where transcripts are saved, and your stats live next door
- Clearer warning when the app can only hear your mic
- Faster and lighter, especially in hour-long sessions

## 0.5.8 — 2026-07-17

- Everything now lives in one main window — no more separate windows to juggle
- Coaching stops automatically when your meeting ends

## 0.5.7 — 2026-07-17

- Slack huddles are now detected
- Dictation no longer triggers "meeting detected"
- Meetings in the browser (Meet, Zoom web) are detected more reliably
- New here? The progress pane now walks you through your first session in three steps
- Fixed a crash when notification permission was denied

## 0.5.6 — 2026-07-17

- Meetings are detected on any microphone, not just the default input
- New: launch MeetMouse at login
- Quit straight from the menu bar dropdown

## 0.5.5 — 2026-07-17

- Meeting auto-detect is now ON by default for fresh installs
- Updates arrive faster — the app checks hourly instead of daily
- The Coaching Style sheet closes itself after a successful save

## 0.5.4 — 2026-07-17

- Transcript export now uses a Zoom-style format, and speaker turns split cleanly at speaker boundaries
- The local AI engine restarts itself if it ever dies mid-session

## 0.5.3 — 2026-07-17

- The meeting-detected card gains a hover-to-reveal close button

## 0.5.2 — 2026-07-17

- A redesigned, more polished meeting-detected card
- Send feedback straight from the menu bar dropdown

## 0.5.1 — 2026-07-17

- Sessions start instantly — no more waiting on the transcription-model download; the higher-accuracy engine fetches in the background and takes over next session
- Coaching styles work without a local AI model via built-in presets
- Fixed wall-of-text transcripts when running mic-only

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-17

- New to MeetMouse? A short demo replays a sample meeting with real nudges on first launch — no mic, no permissions, no downloads
- Live talk meter: a thin You/Them bar in the overlay and transcript shows your share of the conversation as it happens (orange past 65%)
- Reviews work without an AI model: an instant on-device review appears after every session; the AI review remains when a model is installed
- Share your recap: copy or share the post-meeting review (summary, talk ratio, commitments) straight to Slack or email
- Make the coach yours: the new Coaching Style panel turns a plain-English description ("coach me to stop rambling") into your own rubric — toggle any signal, tune how eagerly it fires, add custom signals the AI watches live
- The coach now improves itself, with your approval: it proposes rubric changes backed by your feedback ("you rated this Wrong 8 of 10 times — turn it off?"); nothing changes silently
- Your progress lives in the main window: day streaks, week-over-week nudge and talk-share trends, top patterns, and up to two focus goals that sharpen the signals you care about
- Tell it your role: coaching setup tunes the rubric to how you sell, manage, or run meetings
- Meeting auto-detect (off by default): a menu bar icon offers "Start coaching?" when a meeting app and your mic go live — recording never starts without your click

## 0.4.8 — 2026-07-16

- Export your transcript: after a session ends, a small download button appears at the top of the transcript panel — click it to save the transcript as a text file

## 0.4.6 — 2026-07-14

<!-- 0.4.5 was never tagged, so its notes ship here — updaters come from 0.4.4. -->

- The coach now praises too: green nudges reinforce your best moves the moment they happen — a great open question that gets them talking, handing someone the decision, refocusing a drifting room, locking commitments, and reflecting their point back
- Much more accurate transcripts — a new on-device engine (Parakeet) replaces Apple's speech recognizer. Still 100% on your Mac; downloads a ~600 MB model on first session (falls back to the old engine if the model can't load)
