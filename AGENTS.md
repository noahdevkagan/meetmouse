# Agent guide — MeetMouse

Read this first. It is written for AI coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, …) and for humans who like commands over prose.

## Session workflow (context management)

This file is the seed doc — it auto-loads into every session. Three habits keep long sessions and handoffs lossless:

1. **Plan before building.** Before any multi-step change, write the plan into `HANDOFF.md` under "Current state" → it survives context compaction. (`PLAN.md` is the frozen original build plan — never write there.)
2. **Log the why.** When you make (or reverse) a non-obvious design choice, append one entry to `decisions.md`: what was decided and why. Read it before re-litigating anything.
3. **Hand off at the end.** When the user wraps up ("done", "that's it for today"), run the `/handoff` skill: it rewrites `HANDOFF.md` (state, outstanding, next-session prompt) and commits. A SessionStart hook in `.claude/settings.json` injects `HANDOFF.md` into every new session automatically.

**What this is:** a local-first, zero-telemetry macOS menu-bar + window app (SwiftUI) that listens to live meetings, applies a coaching rubric, and nudges the user in real time. Transcription is on-device (Parakeet/SFSpeech); the LLM runs locally via an embedded Ollama pinned to `127.0.0.1`. Hard constraint: the app must fully work with WiFi off (only model downloads need network).

## Setup (one time)

```bash
brew install xcodegen                       # project generator (no .xcodeproj in git)
git config core.hooksPath scripts/githooks  # enables the push gate (see Tests)
```

Requires Xcode 16+ on macOS 14+.

## Build & run

```bash
cd MeetingCoach
xcodegen                                    # regenerate MeetingCoach.xcodeproj (run after adding/removing files)
xcodebuild -project MeetingCoach.xcodeproj -scheme MeetingCoach \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build build
open -n build/Build/Products/Debug/MeetMouse.app
```

Debug builds show `· dev` in the sidebar footer and an amber dot on the mouse menu-bar icon, so they are never confused with the installed release copy.

## Tests / push gate

Every `git push` runs `scripts/push-gate.sh` (~4 min; docs/markdown-only pushes short-circuit to the changelog check, ~2 s): xcodegen + build → ASR transcript checks (`tests/asr`) → nudge signal regression (`tests/nudges`) → **ship scorecard** (`bench/scorecard.py`, informational — transcription accuracy, Them turn shape, and nudge quality, each vs the previous recorded run; the CI gate renders the same table into every release run's job summary). Benchmark records auto-commit and ride along with the next push. Run the gate directly any time: `./scripts/push-gate.sh`; scorecard alone: `python3 bench/scorecard.py`. On ASR-adjacent changes the gate also records a non-blocking WER trend point from a fixed hard two-speaker conversation (`tests/asr/hard.sh`, ~2 min) into `bench/asr-history.jsonl` — the scorecard shows `synthetic-hard` movement across commits. Escape hatches: `SKIP_GATE=1 git push`, `FAST=1 git push`. Per-suite runners live in each `tests/*/run.sh`.

## Repo map

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `MeetingCoach/MeetingCoach/App/` | App entry, main window UI, menu bar (`MeetMouseApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`) |
| `MeetingCoach/MeetingCoach/Engine/` | Audio capture, transcription, signals, coach, Ollama lifecycle, meeting auto-detect |
| `MeetingCoach/MeetingCoach/ViewModels/` | Live session, settings |
| `MeetingCoach/MeetingCoach/Views/` | Overlay panel, detection pill, dashboards, forms |
| `MeetingCoach/MeetingCoach/Resources/` | Rubric default, demo script, sounds; `ollama/` runtime is **gitignored** (see Gotchas) |
| `MeetingCoach/project.yml` | XcodeGen spec — edit this, not the .xcodeproj |
| `tests/`, `bench/` | Push-gate suites and longitudinal benchmark |
| `rubrics/`, `simulator/` | Rubric YAML examples, offline simulation harness |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Tag-triggered release: build, sign, notarize, DMG, appcast |
| `DISTRIBUTION.md` | Release/signing details for maintainers |

## Gotchas (agents hit these)

- **SourceKit/LSP diagnostics in this repo are noise** (no module context). Trust `xcodebuild` only.
- **`Resources/ollama/` is gitignored and empty in a fresh clone** — the ~80 MB runtime is vendored by CI at release time. Dev builds without it fall back to a system Ollama on `127.0.0.1:11434`; to embed locally run `./scripts/vendor-ollama.sh`.
- **The installed `/Applications/MeetMouse.app` shares UserDefaults and the model store with dev builds.** Never kill its processes. To clean up a dev engine use the Debug-scoped pattern: `pkill -f "Debug/MeetMouse.app.*ollama serve"` — the broad `Resources/ollama` pattern kills the user's live session.
- **First launch shows a welcome sheet** gated by `defaults read com.coach.MeetingCoach hasSeenDemo`; set it to `true` to skip, delete it to re-test onboarding.
- Live capture needs mic + **Screen Recording** permission (system audio). Without Screen Recording the app runs mic-only with a warning banner. The bundled demo (`Watch a 15-second demo`) needs no permissions at all.
- Models/log dir: `~/Library/Application Support/MeetingCoach/ollama/` (engine log: `ollama.log`). Debug app log: `/tmp/mc_debug.log`.

## Release

If the release touches capture, detection, or end-of-meeting logic, run the manual call matrix first (`tests/calls-manual.md`, ~10 min on real hardware) — CI cannot exercise FaceTime/iPhone-relay scenarios and their failures are silent.

Before tagging: add a `## X.Y.Z` section to `CHANGELOG.md` and run `python3 scripts/build-changelog.py` (regenerates the site changelog page; the push gate rejects a release tag without its section, and any push with a stale `docs/changelog.html`). After the release, deploy the site: `npx wrangler pages deploy docs --project-name meetcoach`.

Push a tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. CI first runs the full test gate (`.github/workflows/test-gate.yml` — build + all suites; a failing gate blocks the release), then signs, notarizes, attaches the DMG to a GitHub Release, and updates the Sparkle appcast (users auto-update). Unreleased work batches on `main`; see what's pending with `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..main --oneline`. Do not tag without the maintainer asking.

## Conventions

- Local-first is non-negotiable: no telemetry, no network calls except explicit model/update downloads.
- Signals reason over coalesced speaker *turns*, not raw ASR fragments (`Engine/TranscriptAnalysis.swift`).
- Rubrics are YAML (`Resources/default_rubric.yaml`, user copy under Application Support); round-tripping must never drop fields.
- UI style: shared card language via `.cardStyle()` in `ContentView.swift` — white surfaces, hairline borders, continuous corners; don't introduce new one-off card styles.

## MCP (optional, recommended)

`.mcp.json` at the repo root configures [XcodeBuildMCP](https://github.com/cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP) — build/run/log tools for macOS apps. Claude Code picks it up automatically (approve when prompted). For Codex, add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.xcodebuild]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "xcodebuildmcp@latest"]
```

Plain `xcodebuild` (commands above) is always sufficient — MCP just gives richer tooling.
